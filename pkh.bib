abstract = {Experimental models of heart failure can be used to address specific questions not easily answered in patients, but no single model can reproduce exactly any of the clinical syndromes of heart failure since these are dominated by fatigue and breathlessness. Heart failure may be induced experimentally by pressure loading, volume loading, myocardial infarction, or by the creation of other disease states within the myocardium. Pressure loading may be especially useful in the study of ventricular hypertrophy, cellular derangements and vascular changes. Volume loading may be useful when examining the pathogenesis of hormone and electrolyte disturbances. Models of myocardial infarction or destruction are likely to be the most suitable for assessing novel therapy provided that peripheral reflexes are maintained. Experimental cardiomyopathy can provide an important means of identifying pathological subcellular mechanisms. They may be of use in the evaluation of vasodilator drugs but caution should be exercised in the study of inotropic agents. Any one model may be useful if it permits study of a single factor or variable in isolation or at a time when information is not obtainable from patients. For greatest clinical relevance, studies should be made in conscious animals with intact reflexes.},

abstract = {Cardiac allograft rejection is typically diagnosed on the basis of hematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E) histology of endomyocardial biopsies. This diagnosis is made based on the degree of immune cell infiltrate and associated myocyte damage. However, considerable variability in rejection grading between pathologists can occur. Confocal microscopy provides high contrast and high resolution imaging that has the potential to provide detailed views of pathological features of allograft rejection. In this pilot study we sought to determine if confocal microscopy could be used to detect features of cardiac rejection. This was achieved by collection of additional sample at 30 biopsy procedures from 15 heart transplant patients. Routine pathological grading of H{\&}E histology identified 5 gradings of 0R, 21 gradings of 1R, and 3 gradings of 2R. From these gradings, 3 samples for 0R, 9 samples for 1R, and 3 samples for 2R were imaged by confocal microscopy. This was achieved by fluorescently labeling sections with DAPI, wheat germ agglutinin, and phalloidin, to visualize the cell nuclei, cell border and extracellular matrix, and muscle cell actin, respectively. Labeling with these fluorescent markers was of high contrast. However, we did note variability in DAPI and phalloidin labeling of tissue sections. Confocal imaging of these labels revealed the following features at high resolution: perivascular and/or interstitial infiltrate, myocyte damage, and Quilty lesions. In particular increased detail of damaged myocytes reveals distortion in myofilament organization that could be exploited to distinguish between 1R and 2R grades. In conclusion, confocal microscopy provided high contrast and resolution imaging of cardiac biopsies that could be explored further to aid assessment of cardiac allograft rejection.},

abstract = {The beta1-adrenoceptors ($\beta$(1)AR) and beta-2 ($\beta$(2)AR) adrenoceptors represent the predominant pathway for sympathetic control of myocardial function. Diverse mechanisms have evolved to translate signalling via these two molecules into differential effects on physiology. In this review, we discuss how the functions of the $\beta$AR are organized from the level of secondary messengers to the whole heart to achieve this. Using novel microscopy and bio-imaging methods researchers have uncovered subtle organization of the control of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the predominant positively inotropic pathway for the $\beta$AR. The $\beta$(2)AR in particular is demonstrated to give rise to highly compartmentalized, spatially confined cAMP signals. Organization of $\beta$(2)AR within the T-tubule and caveolae of cardiomyocytes concentrates this receptor with molecules which buffer and shape its cAMP signal to give fine control. This situation is undermined in various forms of heart failure. Human and animal models of heart failure demonstrate disruption of cellular micro-architecture which contributes to the change in response to cardiac $\beta$ARs. Loss of cellular structure has proved key to the observed loss of confined $\beta$(2)AR signalling. Some pharmacological and genetic treatments have been successful in returning failing cells to a more structured phenotype. Within these cells it has been possible to observe the partial restoration of normal $\beta$(2)AR signalling. At the level of the organ, the expression of the two $\beta$AR subtypes varies between regions with the $\beta$(2)AR forming a greater proportion of the $\beta$AR population at the apex. This distribution may contribute to regional wall motion abnormalities in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a syndrome of high sympathetic activity, where the phosphorylated $\beta$(2)AR can signal via Gi protein to produce negatively inotropic effects.},

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images.

abstract = {Many signals have risen and fallen in the tide of investigation into mechanisms of myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). In our opinion, the multifunctional Ca and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a molecule to watch, in part because a solid body of accumulated data essentially satisfy Koch's postulates, showing that the CaMKII pathway is a core mechanism for promoting myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Multiple groups have now confirmed the following: (1) that CaMKII activity is increased in hypertrophied and failing myocardium from animal models and patients; (2) CaMKII overexpression causes myocardial hypertrophy and HF and (3) CaMKII inhibition (by drugs, inhibitory peptides and gene deletion) improves myocardial hypertrophy and HF. Patients with myocardial disease die in equal proportion from HF and arrhythmias, and a major therapeutic obstacle is that drugs designed to enhance myocardial contraction promote arrhythmias. In contrast, inhibiting the CaMKII pathway appears to reduce arrhythmias and improve myocardial responses to pathological stimuli. This brief paper will introduce the molecular physiology of CaMKII and discuss the impact of CaMKII on ion channels, Ca handling proteins and transcription in myocardium. This article is part of a special issue entitled "Key Signaling Molecules in Hypertrophy and Heart Failure".},

abstract = {In most mammalian species force of contraction of cardiac muscle increases with increasing rate of stimulation, i.e. a positive force-frequency relationship. In single mouse ventricular cells, both positive and negative relationships have been described and little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We studied enzymatically isolated single ventricular mouse myocytes, at 30 degrees C. During field stimulation, amplitude of unloaded cell shortening increased with increasing frequency of stimulation (0.04 +/- 0.01 Delta L/L(0) at 1 Hz to 0.07 +/- 0.01 Delta L/L(0) at 4 Hz, n = 12, P {\textless} 0.05). During whole cell voltage clamp with 50 microM [K5-fluo-3](pip), both peak and baseline [Ca(2+)](i) increased at higher stimulation frequencies, but the net Delta[Ca(2+)](i) increased only modestly from 1.59 +/- 0.08 Delta F/F(0) at 1 Hz, to 1.71 +/- 0.11 Delta F/F(0) at 4 Hz (n = 17, P {\textless} 0.05). When a 1 s pause was interposed during stimulation at 2 and 4 Hz, [Ca(2+)](i) transients were significantly larger (at 4 Hz, peak F/F(0) increased by 78 +/- 2 {\%}, n = 5). SR Ca(2+) content assessed during caffeine application, significantly increased from 91 +/- 24 micromol l(-1) at 1 Hz to 173 +/- 20 micromol l(-1) at 4 Hz (n = 5, P {\textless} 0.05). Peak I(Ca,L) decreased at higher frequencies (by 28 +/- 6 {\%} at 2 Hz, and 45 +/- 8 {\%} at 4 Hz), due to slow recovery from inactivation. This loss of I(Ca,L) resulted in reduced fractional release. Thus, in mouse ventricular myocytes the [Ca(2+)](i)-frequency response depends on a balance between the increase in SR content and the loss of trigger I(Ca,L). Small changes in this balance may contribute to variability in frequency-dependent behaviour. In addition, there may be a regulation of the contractile response downstream of [Ca(2+)](i).},

abstract = {The importance of Na-Ca exchange as a trigger for sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release remains controversial. Therefore, we measured whole-cell Ca currents (ICa), Na-Ca exchange currents (INaCa), cellular contractions, and intracellular Ca transients in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes. We found that changing pipette Na concentration markedly affected the relationship between cell shortening (or Ca transients) and voltage, but did not affect the Ca current-voltage relationship. We then inhibited Na-Ca exchange and varied SR content (by changing the number of conditioning pulses before each test pulse). Regardless of SR Ca content, the relationship between contraction and voltage was bell-shaped in the absence of Na-Ca exchange. Next, we rapidly and completely blocked ICa by applying nifedipine to cells. Cellular shortening was variably reduced in the presence of nifedipine. The component of shortening blocked by nifedipine had a bell-shaped relationship with voltage, whereas the "nifedipine-insensitive" component of contraction increased with voltage. With the SR disabled (ryanodine and thapsigargin pretreatment), ICa could initiate late-peaking contractions that were approximately 70{\%} of control amplitude. In contrast, nifedipine-insensitive contractions could not be elicited in the presence of ryanodine and thapsigargin. Finally, we recorded reverse Na-Ca exchange currents that were activated by membrane depolarization. The estimated sarcolemmal Ca flux occurring by Na-Ca exchange (during voltage clamp steps to +30 mV) was approximately 10-fold less than that occurring by ICa. Therefore, Na-Ca exchange alone is unlikely to raise cytosolic Ca concentration enough to directly activate the myofilaments. We conclude that reverse Na-Ca exchange can trigger SR Ca release. Because of the sigmoidal relationship between the open probability of the SR Ca release channel and pCa, the effects of ICa and INaCa may not sum in a linear fashion. Rather, the two triggers may act synergistically in the modulation of SR release.},

@article{Sipido1997a,
abstract = {It has been proposed that Ca2+ entry through the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger can contribute significantly to the trigger for Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We have compared the characteristics of Ca2+ release triggered by reverse-mode Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange and by L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) during depolarizing steps in single guinea pig ventricular myocytes (whole-cell voltage clamp, fluo 3 and fura-red as [Ca2+]i indicators, 36 +/- 1 degrees C, K(+)-based pipette solution with 20 mmol/L [Na+]). Conditioning pulses to +60 mV ensured comparable Ca2+ loading of the SR. In the presence of ICaL, [Ca2+]i transients typically have an early and rapid rising phase reflecting Ca2+ release, which has a bell-shaped voltage dependence with a peak at +10 mV. With Ca2+ entry through Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange only (20 mumol/L nisoldipine), Ca2+ release flux from the SR is decreased and directly related to the amplitude of the depolarizing step. Ca2+ release is preceded by a significant delay (81 +/- 21 ms at +20 mV, 24 +/- 4 ms at +70 mV) related to Ca2+ entry through the exchanger. Triggered release interrupts Ca2+ entry, as evidenced by reversal of the exchanger current. At potentials positive to +40 mV, Ca2+ influx through Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange, calculated from the outward exchange current, reaches magnitudes comparable to ICaL, but Ca2+ release due to reverse-mode Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange still has a significant delay. We calculated trigger efficiency as the ratio between the maximal rate of Ca2+ release and the Ca2+ influx preceding this release; efficiency of reverse-mode Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange is approximately four times less than that of ICaL. With both ICaL and reverse-mode Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange present, Ca2+ release is triggered by ICaL, and a contribution of reverse-mode Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange to the trigger could not be detected at potentials below +60 mV. These characteristics of reverse-mode Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange predict that its role as a trigger for Ca2+ release during the action potential is likely to be negligible.},

abstract = {Increasing use is being made of Gd-DTPA contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for breast cancer assessment since it provides 3D functional information via pharmacokinetic interaction between contrast agent and tumour vascularity, and because it is applicable to women of all ages as well as patients with post-operative scarring. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) is complementary to conventional X-ray mammography, since it is a relatively low-resolution functional counterpart of a comparatively high-resolution 2D structural representation. However, despite the additional information provided by MRI, mammography is still an extremely important diagnostic imaging modality, particularly for several common conditions such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) where it has been shown that there is a strong correlation between microcalcification clusters and malignancy. Pathological indicators such as calcifications and fine spiculations are not visible in CE-MRI and therefore there is clinical and diagnostic value in fusing the high-resolution structural information available from mammography with the functional data acquired from MRI imaging. This paper presents a novel data fusion technique whereby medial-lateral oblique (MLO) and cranial-caudal (CC) mammograms (2D data) are registered to 3D contrast-enhanced MRI volumes. We utilise a combination of pharmacokinetic modelling, projection geometry, wavelet-based landmark detection and thin-plate spline non-rigid 'warping' to transform the coordinates of regions of interest (ROIs) from the 2D mammograms to the spatial reference frame of the contrast-enhanced MRI volume.

abstract = {AIMS: The Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) alpha2-isoform is preferentially located in the t-tubules of cardiomyocytes and is functionally coupled to the Na+/Ca(+-exchanger (NCX) and Ca2+ regulation through intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i). We hypothesized that downregulation of the NKA alpha2-isoform during congestive heart failure (CHF) disturbs the link between Na+ and Ca2+, and thus the control of cardiomyocyte contraction. METHODS AND RESULTS: NKA isoform and t-tubule distributions were studied using immunocytochemistry, confocal and electron microscopy in a post-infarction rat model of CHF. Sham-operated rats served as controls. NKA and NCX currents (I NKA and I NCX) were measured and alpha2-isoform current (I NKA,alpha2) was separated from total I NKA using 0.3 microM ouabain. Detubulation of cardiomyocytes was performed to assess the presence of alpha2-isoforms in the t-tubules. In CHF, the t-tubule network had a disorganized appearance in both isolated cardiomyocytes and fixed tissue. This was associated with altered expression patterns of NKA alpha1- and alpha2-isoforms. I NKA,alpha2 density was reduced by 78{\%} in CHF, in agreement with decreased protein expression (74{\%}). When I NKA,alpha2 was blocked in Sham cardiomyocytes, contractile parameters converged with those observed in CHF. In Sham, abrupt activation of I NKA led to a decrease in I NCX, presumably due to local depletion of [Na+]i in the vicinity of NCX. This decrease was smaller when the alpha2-isoform was downregulated (CHF) or inhibited (ouabain), indicating that the alpha2-isoform is necessary to modulate local [Na+]i close to NCX. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of the alpha2-isoform causes attenuated control of NCX activity in CHF, reducing its capability to extrude Ca2+ from cardiomyocytes.},

abstract = {Heart muscle is characterized by a regular array of proteins and structures that form a repeating functional unit identified as the sarcomere. This regular structure enables tight coupling between electrical activity and Ca 2؉ signaling. In heart failure, multiple cellular defects develop, including reduced contractility, altered Ca 2؉ signaling, and arrhythmias; however, the underlying causes of these defects are not well understood. Here, in ventricular myocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats that develop heart failure, we identify fundamental changes in Ca 2؉ signaling that are related to restructuring of the spatial organization of the cells. Myocytes display both a reduced ability to trigger sarcoplas-mic reticulum Ca 2؉ release and increased spatial dispersion of the transverse tubules (TTs). Remodeled TTs in cells from failing hearts no longer exist in the regularly organized structures found in normal heart cells, instead moving within the sarcomere away from the Z-line structures and leaving behind the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2؉ release channels, the ryanodine receptors (RyRs). These orphaned RyRs appear to be responsible for the dyssynchro-nous Ca 2؉ sparks that have been linked to blunted contractility and, probably, Ca 2؉ -dependent arrhythmias in diverse models of heart failure. We conclude that the increased spatial dispersion of the TTs and orphaned RyRs lead to the loss of local control and Ca 2؉ instability in heart failure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: -Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a major advance for treatment of patients with dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF). However, our understanding of DHF-associated remodeling of subcellular structure and function and their restoration after CRT remains incomplete.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: -We investigated subcellular heterogeneity of remodeling of structures and proteins associated with excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes in DHF and after CRT. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy revealed subcellular heterogeneity of ryanodine receptor (RyR) density and the transverse tubular system (t-system) in a canine model of DHF. RyR density at the ends of lateral left ventricular cardiomyocytes was higher than in cell centers, while the t-system was depleted at cell ends. In anterior left ventricular cardiomyocytes, however, we found a similar degree of heterogeneous RyR remodeling despite preserved t-system. Synchronous heart failure (SHF) was associated with marginal heterogeneity of RyR density. We used rapid scanning confocal microscopy to investigate effects of heterogeneous structural remodeling on calcium signaling. In DHF, diastolic Ca(2+) spark density was smaller at cell ends versus centers. After CRT, subcellular heterogeneity of structures and function was reduced.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: -RyR density exhibits remarkable subcellular heterogeneity in DHF. RyR remodeling occurred in lateral and anterior cardiomyocytes, but remodeling of t-system was confined to lateral myocytes. These findings indicate that different mechanisms underlie remodeling of RyRs and t-system. Furthermore, we suggest that ventricular dyssynchrony exacerbates subcellular remodeling in heart failure. CRT efficiently reduced subcellular heterogeneity. These results will help to explain remodeling of EC coupling in disease and restoration after CRT.},

abstract = {A characteristic histological feature of striated muscle cells is the presence of deep invaginations of the plasma membrane (sarcolemma), most commonly referred to as T-tubules or the transverse-axial tubular system (TATS). TATS mediates the rapid spread of the electrical signal (action potential) to the cell core triggering Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, ultimately inducing myofilament contraction (excitation-contraction coupling). T-tubules, first described in vertebrate skeletal muscle cells, have also been recognized for a long time in mammalian cardiac ventricular myocytes, with a structure and a function that in recent years have been shown to be far more complex and pivotal for cardiac function than initially thought. Renewed interest in T-tubule function stems from the loss and disorganization of T-tubules found in a number of pathological conditions including human heart failure (HF) and dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, as well as in animal models of HF, chronic ischemia and atrial fibrillation. Disease-related remodeling of the TATS leads to asynchronous and inhomogeneous Ca(2+)-release, due to the presence of orphan ryanodine receptors that have lost their coupling with the dihydropyridine receptors and are either not activated or activated with a delay. Here, we review the physiology of the TATS, focusing first on the relationship between function and structure, and then describing T-tubular remodeling and its reversal in disease settings and following effective therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Hypersecretion of amylin is common in individuals with prediabetes, causes amylin deposition and proteotoxicity in pancreatic islets, and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes. Recent studies also identified amylin deposits in failing hearts from patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes and demonstrated that hyperamylinemia accelerates the development of heart dysfunction in rats expressing human amylin in pancreatic $\beta$-cells (HIP rats). To further determine the impact of hyperamylinemia on cardiac myocytes, we investigated human myocardium, compared diabetic HIP rats with diabetic rats expressing endogenous (nonamyloidogenic) rat amylin, studied normal mice injected with aggregated human amylin, and developed in vitro cell models. We found that amylin deposition negatively affects cardiac myocytes by inducing sarcolemmal injury, generating reactive aldehydes, forming amylin-based adducts with reactive aldehydes, and increasing synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) independently of hyperglycemia. These results are consistent with the pathological role of amylin deposition in the pancreas, uncover a novel contributing mechanism to cardiac myocyte injury in type 2 diabetes, and suggest a potentially treatable link of type 2 diabetes with diabetic heart disease. Although further studies are necessary, these data also suggest that IL-1$\beta$ might function as a sensor of myocyte amylin uptake and a potential mediator of myocyte injury.},

abstract = {online publish-ahead-of-print 7 February 2013 Abstract Cardiac excitation–contraction coupling occurs primarily at the sites of transverse (T)-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions. The orderly T-tubule network guarantees the instantaneous excitation and synchronous activation of nearly all Ca 2+ release sites throughout the large ventricular myocyte. Because of the critical roles played by T-tubules and the array of channels and transporters localized to the T-tubule membrane network, T-tubule architecture has recently become an area of considerable research interest in the cardiovascular field. This review will focus on the current knowledge regarding normal T-tubule structure and function in the heart, T-tubule remodelling in the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure, and the impact of T-tubule remodelling on myocyte Ca 2+ handling function. In the last section, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying T-tubule remodelling in heart disease.},

abstract = {Cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) result from the degeneration of synapses and death of neurons in the limbic system and associated regions of the cerebral cortex. An alteration in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in increased production and accumulation of amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$) in the brain. A$\beta$ has been shown to cause synaptic dysfunction and can render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis by a mechanism involving disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis. By inducing membrane lipid peroxidation and generation of the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal, A$\beta$ impairs the function of membrane ion-motive ATPases and glucose and glutamate transporters, and can enhance calcium influx through voltage-dependent and ligand-gated calcium channels. Reduced levels of a secreted form of APP which normally regulates synaptic plasticity and cell survival may also promote disruption of synaptic calcium homeostasis in AD. Some cases of inherited AD are caused by mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 which perturb endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium homeostasis such that greater amounts of calcium are released upon stimulation, possibly as the result of alterations in IP3 and ryanodine receptor channels, Ca2+-ATPases and the ER stress protein Herp. Abnormalities in calcium regulation in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia have also been documented in studies of experimental models of AD, suggesting contributions of these alterations to neuronal dysfunction and cell death in AD. Collectively, the available data show that perturbed cellular calcium homeostasis plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting potential benefits of preventative and therapeutic strategies that stabilize cellular calcium homeostasis.},

abstract = {Phospholamban is a 52-residue integral membrane protein that regulates the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump in cardiac muscle. Its inhibitory action is relieved when phospholamban is phosphorylated at Ser16 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. To computationally explore all possible conformations of the phosphorylated form, and thereby to understand the structural effects of phosphorylation, replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) was applied to the cytoplasmic domain that includes Ser16. The simulations showed that (i) without phosphorylation, the region from Lys3 to Ser16 takes all alpha-helical conformations; (ii) when phosphorylated, the alpha-helix is partially unwound in the C-terminal part (from Ser10 to Ala15) resulting in less extended conformations; (iii) the phosphate at Ser16 forms salt bridges with Arg9, Arg13, and/or Arg14; and (iv) the salt bridges with Arg13 and Arg14 distort the alpha-helix and induce unwinding of the C-terminal part. We then applied conventional all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to the full-length phospholamban in the phospholipid bilayer. The results were consistent with those obtained with REMD simulations, suggesting that the transmembrane part of phospholamban and the lipid bilayer itself have only minor effects on the conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain. The distortions caused by the salt bridges involving the phosphate at Ser16 readily explain the relief of the inhibitory effect of phospholamban by phosphorylation, as they will substantially reduce the population of all helical conformations, which are presumably required for the binding to the calcium pump. This will also be the mechanism for releasing the phosphorylated phospholamban from kinase.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) signaling involves important, wide spread eukaryotic protein-protein interactions. The solved structures of CaM associated with several of its binding targets, the distinctive binding mechanism of CaM, and the significant trypsin sensitivity of the binding targets combine to indicate that the process of association likely involves coupled binding and folding for both CaM and its binding targets. Here, we use bioinformatics approaches to test the hypothesis that CaM-binding targets are intrinsically disordered. We developed a predictor of CaM-binding regions and estimated its performance. Per residue accuracy of this predictor reached 81{\%}, which, in combination with a high recall/precision balance at the binding region level, suggests high predictability of CaM-binding partners. An analysis of putative CaM-binding proteins in yeast and human strongly indicates that their molecular functions are related to those of intrinsically disordered proteins. These findings add to the growing list of examples in which intrinsically disordered protein regions are indicated to provide the basis for cell signaling and regulation.},

abstract = {The left-handed polyproline II (PPII) helix gives rise to a circular dichroism spectrum that is remarkably similar to that of unfolded proteins. This similarity has been used as the basis for the hypothesis that unfolded proteins possess considerable PPII helical content. It has long been known that homopolymers of lysine adopt the PPII helical conformation at neutral pH, presumably a result of electrostatic repulsion between side chains. It is shown here that a seven-residue lysine peptide also adopts the PPII conformation. In contrast with homopolymers of lysine, this short peptide is shown to retain PPII helical character under conditions in which side-chain charges are heavily screened or even neutralized. The most plausible explanation for these observations is that the peptide backbone favors the PPII conformation to maximize favorable interactions with solvent. These data are evidence that unfolded proteins do indeed possess PPII content, indicating that the ensemble of unfolded states is significantly smaller than is commonly assumed.},

abstract = {A muscle model establishing the link between cross-bridge dynamics and intracellular Ca2+kinetics was assessed by simulation of experiments performed in isolated cardiac muscle. The model is composed by the series arrangement of muscle units formed by inextensible thick and thin filaments in parallel with an elastic element. Attached cross-bridges act as independent force generators whose force is linearly related to the elongation of their elastic structure. Ca2+kinetics is described by a four-state system of sites on the thin filament associated with troponin C: sites with free troponin C (T), sites with Ca2+bound to troponin C (TCa); sites with Ca2+bound to troponin C and attached cross-bridges (TCa*); and sites with troponin C not associated with Ca2+and attached cross-bridges (T*). The intracellular Ca2+concentration ( [Ca2+] ) is controlled solely by the sarcoplasmic reticulum through an inflow function and a saturated outflow pump function. All the simulations were performed using the same set of parameters. The model was able to reproduce the following experiments in cardiac muscle: (a) time course of isometric force (peak force: 46.5 mN/mm2), intracellular [Ca2+] (peak [Ca2+]: 1.5$\mu$m); (b) force–length–[Ca2+] relations; (c) transient response of force to step changes in length; (d) force–velocity relation (maximum velocity: 3$\mu$m/s); (e) the force response to length pulses to estimate the time course of [TCa]; (f ) force response to quick releases showing the superactivating and deactivating effects of shortening; (g) stiffness response to sinusoidal length changes; and (h) time course of active state. The good accordance of the simulations with experimental results indicates that the model is an adequate representation of the link between cross-bridge dyamic behaviour and Ca2+kinetics.},

abstract = {It is not clear how many L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) are required to ensure that a Ca2+ spark is triggered during a normal mammalian action potential (AP). We investigated this in rabbit ventricular myocytes by examining both the properties of sparks evoked by APs and the activity of LCCs. We measured Ca2+ sparks evoked by repeated APs with pipettes containing 2 mmol/L EGTA and single LCC activity in cell-attached patches depolarized to +50 mV using pipettes containing 110 mmol/L Ba2+. With 2 mmol/L Ca2+ in the external solution, we observed sparks at the beginning of every evoked AP at numerous locations. Each spark was observed repeatedly at a fixed location and began during a limited interval after the AP peak. These sparks occurred with a probability of approximately unity. However, the chance that an LCC does not open during the interval when a spark is triggered is quite high ( approximately 0.13). Therefore, because single channels open with a probability significantly lower than 1, more than one LCC must be available to ensure that sparks are triggered with a probability of approximately unity. We conclude that it is likely that a cluster of LCCs is involved in gating a cluster of ryanodine receptors at the beginning of an AP.},

In this review, we outline the changes to SR calcium handling in the diabetic state and, through the use of transgenic mice and adenoviral gene therapy, we examine how SR function can be improved by the expression of various proteins that are directly and indirectly involved in calcium handling. Improving SERCA activity plays an important role in ameliorating the contractile phenotype associated with the diabetic state.},

Although both were discovered in thymus tissue, and presumably function in T-cell maturation, they have been detected in other tissue settings. We have conducted detailed Ca2+- and Mg2+-binding studies on recombinant ATH and the C72S variant of CPV3, employing global analysis of isothermal titration calorimetry data. In Hepes-buffered saline, ATH binds Ca2+ with apparent microscopic binding constants of 2.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(8) and 1.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(8) M(-1). The corresponding values for CPV3-C72S are substantially lower, 4.5 +/- 0.5 x 10(7) and 2.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(7) M(-1), a 1.9-kcal/mol difference in binding free energy. Thus, the beta-parvalbumin lineage displays a spectrum of Ca2+-binding affinity, with ATH and the mammalian beta isoform at the high- and low-affinity extremes and CPV3 in the middle. Interestingly, despite its decreased Ca2+ affinity, CPV3-C72S exhibits increased affinity for Mg2+, relative to ATH. Whereas the latter displays Mg2+-binding constants of 2.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) and 1.2 +/- 0.1 x 10(4) M(-1), CPV3-C72S yields values of 5.0 +/- 0.8 x 10(4) and 2.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(4) M(-1).},

abstract = {A rigorous statistical mechanical formulation of the equilibrium properties of selective ion channels is developed, incorporating the influence of the membrane potential, multiple occupancy, and saturation effects. The theory provides a framework for discussing familiar quantities and concepts in the context of detailed microscopic models. Statistical mechanical expressions for the free energy profile along the channel axis, the cross-sectional area of the pore, and probability of occupancy are given and discussed. In particular, the influence of the membrane voltage, the significance of the electric distance, and traditional assumptions concerning the linearity of the membrane electric field along the channel axis are examined. Important findings are: 1) the equilibrium probabilities of occupancy of multiply occupied channels have the familiar algebraic form of saturation properties which is obtained from kinetic models with discrete states of denumerable ion occupancy (although this does not prove the existence of specific binding sites; 2) the total free energy profile of an ion along the channel axis can be separated into an intrinsic ion-pore free energy potential of mean force, independent of the transmembrane potential, and other contributions that arise from the interfacial polarization; 3) the transmembrane potential calculated numerically for a detailed atomic configuration of the gramicidin A channel embedded in a bilayer membrane with explicit lipid molecules is shown to be closely linear over a distance of 25 Angstrom along the channel axis. Therefore, the present analysis provides some support for the constant membrane potential field approximation, a concept that has played a central role in the interpretation of flux data based on traditional models of ion permeation. It is hoped that this formulation will provide a sound physical basis for developing nonequilibrium theories of ion transport in selective biological channels.},

Above the critical micelle concentration of a bulk silica–surfactant solution, films of mesophases with hexagonally packed one-dimensional channels can be formed at solid–liquid and liquid–vapour interfaces3, 4, 5. But this process is slow and the supported films3, 5 are granular and with the pore channels oriented parallel to the substrate surface, so that transport across the films is not facilitated by the pores. Ogawa6, 7 has reported a rapid spin-coating procedure for making transparent mesoporous films, but their formation mechanism, microstructure and pore accessibility have not been elucidated. Here we report a sol–gel-based dip-coating method for the rapid synthesis of continuous mesoporous thin films on a solid substrate. The influence of the substrate generates film mesostructures that have no bulk counterparts, such as composites with incipient liquid-crystalline order of the surfactant–silica phase. We are also able to form mesoporous films of the cubic phase, in which the pores are connected in a three-dimensional network that guarantees their accessibility from the film surface. We demonstrate and quantify this accessibility using a surface-acoustic-wave nitrogen-adsorption technique. We use fluorescence depolarization to monitor the evolution of the mesophase in situ, and see a progression through a sequence of lamellar to cubic to hexagonal structures that has not previously been reported.},

We have designed and characterized a chimeric troponin C-troponin I hybrid protein with a cleavable linker that is useful for producing isotopically labeled troponin peptides, stabilizes their interaction, and has proven to be a faithful representation of the original complex in the systolic state, but lacking its disadvantages, making it particularly suitable for drug screening and structural studies.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Forty-five distinct subfamilies of EF-hand proteins have been identified. They contain from two to eight EF-hands that are recognizable by amino acid sequence as being statistically similar to other EF-hand domains. All proteins within one subfamily are congruent to one another, i.e. the dendrogram computed from one of the EF-hand domains is similar, within statistical error, to the dendrogram computed from another(s) domain. Thirteen subfamilies--including Calmodulin, Troponin C, Essential light chain, Regulatory light chain--referred to collectively as CTER, are congruent with one another. They appear to have evolved from a single ur-domain by two cycles of gene duplication and fusion. The subfamilies of CTER subsequently evolved by gene duplications and speciations. The remaining 32 subfamilies do not show such general patterns of congruence; however, some--such as S100, intestinal calcium binding protein (calbindin 9 kd), and trichohylin--do not form congruent clusters of subfamilies. Nearly all of the domains 1, 3, 5, and 7 are most similar to other ODD domains. Correspondingly the EVEN numbered domains of all 45 subfamilies most closely resemble EVEN domains of other subfamilies. Many sequence and chemical characteristics do not show systemic trends by subfamily or species of host organisms; such homoplasy is widespread. Eighteen of the subfamilies are heterochimeric; in addition to multiple EF-hands they contain domains of other evolutionary origins.},

Specifically, finite element methods have been developed to calculate ligand binding rate constants for large biomolecules. The resulting software has been validated and applied to the mouse acetylcholinesterase (mAChE) monomer and several tetramers. Rates for inhibitor binding to mAChE were calculated at various ionic strengths with several different time steps. Calculated rates show very good agreement with experimental and theoretical steady-state studies. Furthermore, these finite element methods require significantly fewer computational resources than existing particle-based Brownian dynamics methods and are robust for complicated geometries. The key finding of biological importance is that the rate accelerations of the monomeric and tetrameric mAChE that result from electrostatic steering are preserved under the non-steady-state conditions that are expected to occur in physiological circumstances.},

To explore these issues, we developed a spatially explicit, mechanochemical model of skeletal muscle contraction. With a simple three-state model of the cross-bridge cycle, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compute the instantaneous balance of forces throughout the filament lattice, accounting for both thin and thick filament distortions in response to cross-bridge forces. This approach is compared to more traditional mass action kinetic models (in the form of coupled partial differential equations) that assume filament inextensibility. We also monitored instantaneous force generation, ATP utilization, and the dynamics of the cross-bridge cycle in simulations of step changes in length and variations in shortening velocity. Three critical results emerge from our analyses: 1) there is a significant realignment of actin-binding sites in response to cross-bridge forces, 2) this realignment recruits additional cross-bridge binding, and 3) we predict mechanical behaviors that are consistent with experimental results for velocity and length transients. Binding site realignment depends on the relative compliance of the filament lattice and cross-bridges, and within the measured range of these parameters, gives rise to a sharply tuned peak for force generation. Such mechanical tuning at the molecular level is the result of mechanical coupling between individual cross-bridges, mediated by thick filament deformations, and the resultant realignment of binding sites on the thin filament.},

abstract = {Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes requires Ca(2+) influx through dihydropyridine receptors in the sarcolemma, which gates Ca(2+) release through sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Ca(2+) influx, release and diffusion produce a cytosolic Ca(2+) transient. Here, we investigated the relationship between Ca(2+) transients and the spatial arrangement of the sarcolemma including the transverse tubular system (t-system). To accomplish this, we studied isolated ventricular myocytes of rabbit, which exhibit a heterogeneously distributed t-system. We developed protocols for fluorescent labeling and triggered two-dimensional confocal microscopic imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution. From sequences of microscopic images, we measured maximal upstroke velocities and onset times of local Ca(2+) transients together with their distance from the sarcolemma. Analyses indicate that not only sarcolemmal release sites, but also those that are within 1 $\mu$m of the sarcolemma actively release Ca(2+). Our data also suggest that release does not occur at sites further than 2.5 $\mu$m from the sarcolemma. The experimental data are in agreement with results from a mathematical model of Ca(2+) release and diffusion. Our findings can be explained by a modified local control model, which constrains the region of regenerative activation of non-junctional RyR clusters. We believe that this model will be useful for describing excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes with a sparse t-system, which includes those from diseased heart tissue as well as atrial myocytes of some species.},

@article{Holst2000,
abstract = {This article is the first of two articles On the adaptive multilevel finite element treatment of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), a nonlinear eliptic equation arising in biomolecular modeling. Fast and accurate numerical solution of the PBE is usually difficult to accomplish, due to the presence of discontinuous coefficients, delta functions, three spatial dimensions, unbounded domain, and rapid (exponential) nonlinearity. In this first article, we explain how adaptive multilevel finite element methods can be used to obtain extremely accurate solutions to the PBE with very modest computational resources, and we present some illustrative examples using two well-known test problems. The PBE is first discretized with piece-wise linear finite elements over a very coarse simplex triangulation of the domain. The resulting nonlinear algebraic equations are solved with global inexact Newton methods, which we have described in an article appearing previously in this journal. A posteriori error estimates are then computed from this discrete solution, which then drives a simplex subdivision algorithm for performing adaptive mesh refinement. The discretize-solve-estimate-refine procedure is then repeated, until a nearly uniform solution quality is obtained. The sequence of unstructured meshes is used to apply multilevel methods in conjunction with global inexact Newton methods, so that the cost of solving the nonlinear algebraic equations at each step approaches optimal O(N) linear complexity. All of the numerical procedures are implemented. in MANIFOLD CODE (MC), a computer program designed and built by the first author over several years at Caltech and UC San Diego. MC is designed to solve a very general class of nonlinear elliptic equations on complicated domains in two and three dimensions. We describe some of the key features of MC, and give a detailed analysis of its performance for two model PBE problems, with comparisons to the alternative methods. It is shown that the best available uniform mesh-based finite difference or box-method algorithms, including multilevel methods, require substantially more time to reach a target PBE solution accuracy than the adaptive multilevel methods in MC. in the second article, we develop an error estimator based on geometric solvent accessibility, and present a series of detailed numerical experiments for several complex biomolecules.

abstract = {Fluctuations arise universally in nature as a reflection of the discrete microscopic world at the macroscopic level. Despite their apparent noisy origin, fluctuations encode fundamental aspects of the physics of the system at hand, crucial to understand irreversibility and nonequilibrium behavior. To sustain a given fluctuation, a system traverses a precise optimal path in phase space. Here we show that by demanding invariance of optimal paths under symmetry transformations, new and general fluctuation relations valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium are unveiled. This opens an unexplored route toward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing symmetry principles to the realm of fluctuations. We illustrate this concept studying symmetries of the current distribution out of equilibrium. In particular we derive an isometric fluctuation relation that links in a strikingly simple manner the probabilities of any pair of isometric current fluctuations. This relation, which results from the time-reversibility of the dynamics, includes as a particular instance the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem in this context but adds a completely new perspective on the high level of symmetry imposed by time-reversibility on the statistics of nonequilibrium fluctuations. The new symmetry implies remarkable hierarchies of equations for the current cumulants and the nonlinear response coefficients, going far beyond Onsager's reciprocity relations and Green-Kubo formulas. We confirm the validity of the new symmetry relation in extensive numerical simulations, and suggest that the idea of symmetry in fluctuations as invariance of optimal paths has far-reaching consequences in diverse fields.},

A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques both in vitro and in live cells, we show that the R9C mutation increases the stability of the PLN pentameric assembly via disulfide bridge formation, preventing its binding to Ca(2+)-ATPase as well as phosphorylation by protein kinase A. These effects are enhanced under oxidizing conditions, suggesting that oxidative stress may exacerbate the cardiotoxic effects of the PLN(R9C) mutant. These results reveal a regulatory role of the PLN pentamer in calcium homeostasis, going beyond the previously hypothesized role of passive storage for active monomers.},

abstract = {Assembly of an inward rectifier K+ channel pore (Kir6.1/Kir6.2) and an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding regulatory subunit (SUR1/SUR2A/SUR2B) forms ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel heteromultimers, widely distributed in metabolically active tissues throughout the body. KATP channels are metabolism-gated biosensors functioning as molecular rheostats that adjust membrane potential-dependent functions to match cellular energetic demands. Vital in the adaptive response to (patho)physiological stress, KATP channels serve a homeostatic role ranging from glucose regulation to cardioprotection. Accordingly, genetic variation in KATP channel subunits has been linked to the etiology of life-threatening human diseases. In particular, pathogenic mutations in KATP channels have been identified in insulin secretion disorders, namely, congenital hyperinsulinism and neonatal diabetes. Moreover, KATP channel defects underlie the triad of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND syndrome). KATP channelopathies implicated in patients with mechanical and/or electrical heart disease include dilated cardiomyopathy (with ventricular arrhythmia; CMD1O) and adrenergic atrial fibrillation. A common Kir6.2 E23K polymorphism has been associated with late-onset diabetes and as a risk factor for maladaptive cardiac remodeling in the community-at-large and abnormal cardiopulmonary exercise stress performance in patients with heart failure. The overall mutation frequency within KATP channel genes and the spectrum of genotype-phenotype relationships remain to be established, while predicting consequences of a deficit in channel function is becoming increasingly feasible through systems biology approaches. Thus, advances in molecular medicine in the emerging field of human KATP channelopathies offer new opportunities for targeted individualized screening, early diagnosis, and tailored therapy.},

An overview of techniques to determine entropy differences is given, and the accuracy and convergence behavior of five methods based on thermodynamic integration and perturbation techniques was evaluated using liquid water as a test system. Reasonably accurate entropy differences are obtained through thermodynamic integration in which many copies of a solute are desolvated. When only one solute molecule is involved, only two methods seem to yield useful results, the calculation of solute-solvent entropy through thermodynamic integration, and the calculation of solvation entropy through the temperature derivative of the corresponding free-energy difference. One-step perturbation methods seem unsuitable to obtain entropy estimates.},

H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2809-2815), parts of the phosphorylation and nucleotide binding/hinge domains of the Ca(2+)-ATPase were shown to be essential for phospholamban interaction. In order to identify the sites in phospholamban which interact with the Ca(2+)-ATPase, a series of mutants containing amino acid replacements in the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of phospholamban were co-expressed with the cardiac/slow-twitch muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase isozyme, SERCA2a, in HEK-293 cells. Mutation of residues in the cytoplasmic 1A domain of phospholamban, including positively charged residues, Lys3, Arg9, Arg13, and Arg14, negatively charged residue, Glu2, hydrophobic residues, Val4, Leu7, Ala11, Ile12, Ala15, and Ile18, and phosphorylation site residues, Ser16 and Thr17, resulted in loss of the inhibitory effect of phospholamban on Ca2+ transport by the Ca(2+)-ATPase. By contrast, mutation of Met1, Gln5, Tyr6, Thr8, Ser10, Glu19, or Met20 or of residues in the cytoplasmic 1B domain (Pro21 to Asn30) and of Cys41 in the transmembrane domain (Leu31 to Leu52) did not diminish the inhibitory effects of phospholamban on Ca2+ transport. These results suggest that a region essential for functional association of phospholamban with the Ca(2+)-ATPase lies in the cytoplasmic 1A domain of phospholamban.},

As the twenty-first century unfolds, nanotechnology's impact on the health, wealth, and security of the world's people is expected to be at least as significant as the combined influences in this century of antibiotics, the integrated circuit, and human-made polymers. Dr. Neal Lane, Advisor to the President for Science and Technology and former National Science Foundation (NSF) director, stated at a Congressional hearing in April 1998, "If I were asked for an area of science and engineering that will most likely produce the breakthroughs of tomorrow, I would point to nanoscale science and engineering. " Recognizing this potential, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have issued a joint memorandum to Federal agency heads that identifies nanotechnology as a research priority area for Federal investment in fiscal year 2001. This report charts "Nanotechnology Research Directions," as developed by the Interagency W orking Group on Nano Science, Engineering, and Technology (IWGN) of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The report incorporates the views of leading experts from government, academia, and the private sector. It reflects the consensus reached at an IWGN-sponsored workshop held on January 27-29, 1999, and detailed in contributions submitted thereafter by members of the V. S. science and engineering community. (See Appendix A for a list of contributors.},

abstract = {Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is the calcium-dependent switch for contraction in heart muscle and a potential target for drugs in the therapy of congestive heart failure. This calmodulin-like protein consists of two lobes connected by a central linker; each lobe contains two EF-hand domains. The regulatory N-terminal lobe of cTnC, unlike that of skeletal troponin C (sTnC), contains only one functional EF-hand and does not open fully upon the binding of Ca(2+). We have determined the crystal structure of cTnC, with three bound Ca(2+) ions, complexed with the calcium-sensitizer bepridil, to 2.15-A resolution. In contrast to apo- and 3Ca(2+)-cTnC, the drug-bound complex displays a fully open N-terminal lobe similar to the N-terminal lobes of 4Ca(2+)-sTnC and cTnC bound to a C-terminal fragment of cardiac troponin I (residues 147-163). The closing of the lobe is sterically hindered by one of the three bound bepridils. Our results provide a structural basis for the Ca(2+)-sensitizing effect of bepridil and reveal the details of a distinctive two-stage mechanism for Ca(2+) regulation by troponin C in cardiac muscle.},

@article{Kiel2004,
abstract = {Association of two proteins can be described as a two-step process, with the formation of an encounter complex followed by desolvation and establishment of a tight complex. Here, by using the computer algorithm PARE, we designed a set of mutants of the Ras effector protein Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) with optimized electrostatic steering. The fastest binding RalGDS mutant, M26K,D47K,E54K, binds Ras 14-fold faster and 25-fold tighter compared with WT. A linear correlation was found between the calculated and experimental data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a slope of 0.65 for the 24 mutants produced. The data suggest that increased electrostatic steering specifically stabilizes the encounter complex and transition state. This conclusion is backed up by Phi analysis of the encounter complex and transition state of the RalGDS(M26K,D47K,ES4K)/Ras complex, with both values being close to 1. Upon further formation of the final complex, the increased Coulombic interactions are probably counterbalanced by the cost of desolvation of charges, keeping the dissociation rate constant almost unchanged. This mechanism is also reflected by the mutual compensation of enthalpy and entropy changes quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding constants of the faster binding RalGDS mutants toward Ras are similar to those of Raf, the most prominent Ras effector, suggesting that the design methodology may be used to switch between signal transduction pathways.},

abstract = {The central role of T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) diadic junctions in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in adult (AD) ventricular myocytes suggests that their absence in newborn (NB) cells may manifest as an altered EC coupling phenotype. We used confocal microscopy to compare fluo-3 [Ca2+](i) transients in the subsarcolemmal space and cell center of field-stimulated NE and AD rabbit ventricular myocytes. Peak systolic [Ca2+](i) occurred sooner and was higher in the subsarcolemmal space compared with the cell center in NE myocytes. In AD myocytes, [Ca2+](i) rose and declined with similar profiles at the cell center and subsarcolemmal space. Disabling the SR (10 mu mol/L thapsigargin) slowed the rate of rise and decline of Ca2+ in AD myocytes but did not alter Ca2+ transient kinetics in NE myocytes. In contrast to adults, localized SR Ca2+ release events ("Ca2+ sparks") occurred predominantly at the cell periphery of NE myocytes. Immunolabeling experiments demonstrated overlapping distributions of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and ryanodine receptors (RyR2) in AD myocytes. In contrast, RyR2s were spatially separated from the sarcolemma in NE myocytes. Confocal sarcolemmal imaging of di-8-ANEPPS-treated myocytes confirmed an extensive T-tubule network in AD cells, and that T-tubules are absent in NE myocytes. A mathematical model of subcellular Ca2+ dynamics predicts that Ca2+ flux via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger during an action potential can account for the subsarcolemmal Ca2+ gradients in NE myocytes. Spatial separation of sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry from SR Ca2+ release channels may minimize the role of SR Ca2+ release during normal EC coupling in NE ventricular myocytes.},

@article{Cannell1994,
abstract = {The intracellular calcium ([Ca2+](i)) transient in adult rat heart cells was examined using the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 and a laser scanning confocal microscope. We find that the electrically evoked [Ca2+](i) transient does not rise at a uniform rate at all points within the cell during the [Ca2+](i) transient. These spatial non-uniformities in [Ca2+](i) are observed immediately upon depolarization and largely disappear by the time the peak of the [Ca2+](i) transient occurs. Importantly, some of the spatial non-uniformity in [Ca2+](i) varies randomly in location from beat to beat. Analysis of the spatial character of the non-uniformities suggests that they arise from the stochastic nature of the activation of SR calcium-release channels. The non-uniformities in [Ca2+](i) are markedly enhanced by low concentrations of Cd2+, suggesting that activation of L-type calcium channels is the primary source of activator calcium for the calcium transient. In addition, the pattern of calcium release in these conditions was very similar to the spontaneous calcium sparks that are observed under resting conditions and which are due to spontaneous calcium release from the SR. The spatial non-uniformity in the evoked [Ca2+](i) transient under normal conditions can be explained by the temporal and spatial summation of a large number of calcium sparks whose activation is a stochastic process. The results are discussed with respect to a stochastic local control model for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, and it is proposed that the fundamental unit of E-C coupling consists of one dihydropyridine receptor activating a small group of ryanodine receptors (possibly four) in a square packing model.},

abstract = {The kinetics of the irreversible diffusion-influenced reaction between a protein (P) and a ligand (L) is studied when [L] much greater than [P] and the reactivity is stochastically gated due to conformational fluctuations of one of the species. If gating is due to the ligand, we show that the Smoluchowski rate equation, d[P(t)]/dt = -k(t)[L][P(t)], can be generalized by simply using a stochastically-gated time-dependent rate coefficient, k(sg)(t). However, if gating is due to the protein, this is no longer true, except when the gating dynamics is sufficiently fast or the Ligand concentration is very low. The dynamics of ail the ligands around a protein become correlated even when they diffuse independently. An approximate theory for the kinetics of protein-gated reactions that is exact in both the fast and slow gating limits is developed. In order to test this theory, a Brownian dynamics simulation algorithm based on a path-integral formulation is introduced to calculate both k(sg)(t) and the time dependence of the protein concentration. Illustrative simulations using a simple model are carried out for a variety of gating rates. The results are in good agreement with the approximate theory.},

@article{Pradhan2011,
abstract = {Ca(2+) is an important regulatory ion and alteration of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis can lead to cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. Ca(2+) is transported into respiring mitochondria via the Ca(2+) uniporter, which is known to be inhibited by Mg(2+). This uniporter-mediated mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport is also shown to be influenced by inorganic phosphate (Pi). Despite a large number of experimental studies, the kinetic mechanisms associated with the Mg(2+) inhibition and Pi regulation of the uniporter function are not well established. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effects of Mg(2+) and Pi on the uniporter function, we developed here a mathematical model based on known kinetic properties of the uniporter and presumed Mg(2+) inhibition and Pi regulation mechanisms. The model is extended from our previous model of the uniporter that is based on a multistate catalytic binding and interconversion mechanism and Eyring's free energy barrier theory for interconversion. The model satisfactorily describes a wide variety of experimental data sets on the kinetics of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. The model also appropriately depicts the inhibitory effect of Mg(2+) on the uniporter function, in which Ca(2+) uptake is hyperbolic in the absence of Mg(2+) and sigmoid in the presence of Mg(2+). The model suggests a mixed-type inhibition mechanism for Mg(2+) inhibition of the uniporter function. This model is critical for building mechanistic models of mitochondrial bioenergetics and Ca(2+) handling to understand the mechanisms by which Ca(2+) mediates signaling pathways and modulates energy metabolism.},

A top-down octree subdivision coupled with a dual contouring method is used to rapidly extract adaptive 3D finite element meshes with correct topology from volumetric imaging data. The edge contraction and smoothing methods are used to improve mesh quality. The main contribution is extending the dual contouring method to crack-free interval volume 3D meshing with boundary feature sensitive adaptation. Compared to other tetrahedral extraction methods from imaging data, our method generates adaptive and quality 3D meshes without introducing any hanging nodes. The algorithm has been successfully applied to constructing quality meshes for finite element calculations. ent calculations.},

abstract = {Cardiomyocyte T tubules are important for regulating ion flux. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a T-tubule protein associated with calcium channel trafficking that is downregulated in failing hearts. Here we find that cardiac T tubules normally contain dense protective inner membrane folds that are formed by a cardiac isoform of BIN1. In mice with cardiac Bin1 deletion, T-tubule folding is decreased, which does not change overall cardiomyocyte morphology but leads to free diffusion of local extracellular calcium and potassium ions, prolonging action-potential duration and increasing susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. We also found that T-tubule inner folds are rescued by expression of the BIN1 isoform BIN1+13+17, which promotes N-WASP-dependent actin polymerization to stabilize the T-tubule membrane at cardiac Z discs. BIN1+13+17 recruits actin to fold the T-tubule membrane, creating a 'fuzzy space' that protectively restricts ion flux. When the amount of the BIN1+13+17 isoform is decreased, as occurs in acquired cardiomyopathy, T-tubule morphology is altered, and arrhythmia can result.},

abstract = {Multiple mutations in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) have been associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two mutations are located in the cTnI inhibitory domain, a highly negatively charged region that alternately binds to either actin or troponin C, depending on the intracellular concentration of calcium. This region is critical to the inhibition of actin-myosin crossbridge formation when intracellular calcium is low. We modeled one of the inhibitory domain mutations, arginine145--{\textgreater}glycine (TnI(146Gly) in the mouse sequence), by cardiac-specific expression of the mutated protein in transgenic mice. Multiple lines were generated with varying degrees of expression to establish a dose relationship; the severity of phenotype could be correlated directly with transgene expression levels. Transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type cTnI were generated as controls and analyzed in parallel with the TnI(146Gly) animals. The control mice showed no abnormalities, indicating that the phenotype of TnI(146Gly) was not simply an artifact of transgenesis. In contrast, TnI(146Gly) mice showed cardiomyocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis and suffered premature death. The functional alterations that seem to be responsible for the development of cardiac disease include increased skinned fiber sensitivity to calcium and, at the whole organ level, hypercontractility with diastolic dysfunction. Severely affected lines develop a pathology similar to human familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but within a dramatically shortened time frame. These data establish the causality of this mutation for cardiac disease, provide an animal model for understanding the resultant pathogenic structure-function relationships, and highlight the differences in phenotype severity of the troponin mutations between human and mouse hearts.},

abstract = {The inhibitory interaction of phospholamban (PLN) with the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase isoform 1 (SERCA1a) was modeled on the basis of several constraints which included (i) spontaneous formation of SS-bridges between mutants L321C in transmembrane helix 4 (M4) of SERCA1a and N27C in PLN and between V89C (M4) and V49C (PLN); (ii) definition of the face of the PLN transmembrane helix that interacts with SERCA; (iii) cross-linking between Lys-3 of PLN and Lys-397 and Lys-400 of SERCA2a. The crystal structure of SERCA1a in the absence of Ca(2+), which binds PLN, was used as the structure into which an atomic model of PLN was built. PLN can fit into a transmembrane groove formed by the juxtaposition of M2, the upper part of M4, M6, and M9. In the SERCA1a structure with bound Ca(2+), this groove is closed, accounting for the ability of Ca(2+) to disrupt PLN-SERCA interactions. Near the cytoplasmic surface of the bilayer, the PLN helix is disrupted to prevent its collision with M4. The model can be extended into the cytoplasmic domain so that Lys-3 in PLN can be cross-linked with Lys-397 and Lys-400 in SERCA1a with little unwinding of the N-terminal helix of PLN.},

abstract = {We present a biophysically based kinetic model of the cardiac SERCA pump that consolidates a range of experimental data into a consistent and thermodynamically constrained framework. The SERCA model consists of a number of sub-states with partial reactions that are sensitive to Ca2+ and pH, and to the metabolites MgATP, MgADP, and Pi. Optimization of model parameters to fit experimental data favors a fully cooperative Ca2+-binding mechanism and predicts a Ca2+/H+ counter-transport stoichiometry of 2. Moreover, the order of binding of the partial reactions, particularly the binding of MgATP, proves to be a strong determinant of the ability of the model to fit the data. A thermodynamic investigation of the model indicates that the binding of MgATP has a large inhibitory effect on the maximal reverse rate of the pump. The model is suitable for integrating into whole-cell models of cardiac electrophysiology and Ca2+ dynamics to simulate the effects on the cell of compromised metabolism arising in ischemia and hypoxia.},

abstract = {Based on realistic mechanisms of Ca2+ buffering that include both stationary and mobile buffers, we derive and investigate models of Ca2+ diffusion in the presence of rapid buffers. We obtain a single transport equation for Ca2+ that contains the effects caused by both stationary and mobile buffers. For stationary buffers alone, we obtain an expression for the effective diffusion constant of Ca2+ that depends on local Ca2+ concentrations. Mobile buffers, such as fura-2, BAPTA, or small endogenous proteins, give rise to a transport equation that is no longer strictly diffusive. Calculations are presented to show that these effects can modify greatly the manner and rate at which Ca2+ diffuses in cells, and we compare these results with recent measurements by Allbritton et al. (1992). As a prelude to work on Ca2+ waves, we use a simplified version of our model of the activation and inhibition of the IP3 receptor Ca2+ channel in the ER membrane to illustrate the way in which Ca2+ buffering can affect both the amplitude and existence of Ca2+ oscillations.},

abstract = {The stiffness of glycerinated rabbit psoas fibers in the rigor state was measured at various sarcomere lengths in order to determine the distribution of the sarcomere compliance between the cross-bridge and other structures. The stiffness was determined by measuring the tension increment at one end of a fiber segment while stretching the other end of the fiber. The contribution of the end compliance to the rigor segments was checked both by laser diffractometry of the sarcomere length change and by measuring the length dependence of the Young's modulus; the contribution was found to be small. The stiffness in the rigor state was constant at sarcomere lengths of 2.4 microns or less; at greater sarcomere lengths the stiffness, when corrected for the contribution of resting stiffness, scaled with the amount of overlap between the thick and thin filaments. These results suggest that the source of the sarcomere compliance of the rigor fiber at the full overlapping of filaments is mostly the cross-bridge compliance.},

Here, we report a 2.4-angstrom-resolution crystal structure of the Ca2+ -ATPase in the absence of Ca2+ stabilized by two inhibitors, dibutyidihydroxybenzene, which bridges two transmembrane helices, and thapsigargin, also bound in the membrane region. Now visualized are water and several phospholipid molecules, one of which occupies a cleft between two transmembrane helices. Atomic models of the Ca2+ binding sites with explicit hydrogens derived by continuum electrostatic calculations show how water and protons fill the space and compensate charge imbalance created by Ca2+-release. They suggest that H+ countertransport is a consequence of a requirement for maintaining structural integrity of the empty Ca2+-binding sites. For this reason, cation countertransport is probably mandatory for all P-type ATPases and possibly accompanies transport of water as well.},

abstract = {Allosteric transitions are one of the subtler mechanisms used by nature to fine tune protein activity. Effector binding to a specific site on the protein surface induces significant activity change, and initiates a conformational transition that frequently includes domain motions and is very large. From a theoretical and biophysical perspective two problems are particularly intriguing. The first is the way in which a launching signal, which is spatially confined and includes only a few interacting atoms, is propagated to a large-scale conformational transition we frequently see in allosteric transitions. Hence, there is the question of how a small perturbation is magnified to yield motions of thousands of atoms. The second puzzle is of focus, coherence, and efficiency. The impact of the binding of the effector is sometimes extended over tens of angstroms. How the signal is transmitted and kept significant over such large distances in the 'noisy' molecular environment is another major direction of investigation. In the present review we examined different theoretical and computational attempts to solve the questions.},

abstract = {Heart sarcolemmal membranes were isolated by the sucrose density gradient method from rats with chronic diabetes induced by a streptozotocin (65 mg/kg iv) injection. Na+-dependent Ca2+-uptake activities were significantly depressed in diabetic sarcolemmal membranes; such alterations were evident at different incubation times and at different concentrations of Ca2+. Administration of insulin to diabetic rats normalized the Na+-dependent Ca2+-uptake activities. ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation and Ca2+-stimulated Mg2+-dependent ATPase, which represents Ca2+-pump mechanisms, were significantly depressed in sarcolemmal preparations for diabetic rats and these changes were also reversible upon insulin treatment. An increase in lysophosphatidylcholine and a decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine as well as diphosphatidylglycerol contents were observed in heart membranes isolated from diabetic rats but other phospholipids were unchanged. Cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio was significantly increased in preparations from diabetic rats. These results indicate a depression in the ability of the cell to remove Ca2+ through Na+-Ca2+ exchange and Ca2+-pump mechanisms in sarcolemma, and these defects may contribute to the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and diabetic cardiomyopathy.},

@article{Stolen2009,
abstract = {In the present study we explored the mechanisms behind excitation-contraction (EC) coupling defects in cardiomyocytes from mice with type-2 diabetes (db/db).
We determined whether 13 weeks of aerobic interval training could restore cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) cycling and EC coupling.
Reduced contractility in cardiomyocytes isolated from sedentary db/db was associated with increased diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-Ca(2+) leak, reduced synchrony of Ca(2+) release, reduced transverse (T)-tubule density, and lower peak systolic and diastolic Ca(2+) and caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release. Additionally, the rate of SR Ca(2+) ATPase-mediated Ca(2+) uptake during diastole was reduced, whereas a faster recovery from caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release indicated increased Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger activity. The increased SR-Ca(2+) leak was attributed to increased Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKIIdelta) phosphorylation, supported by the normalization of SR-Ca(2+) leak on inhibition of CaMKIIdelta (AIP). Exercise training restored contractile function associated with restored SR Ca(2+) release synchronicity, T-tubule density, twitch Ca(2+) amplitude, SR Ca(2+) ATPase and Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger activities, and SR-Ca(2+) leak. The latter was associated with reduced phosphorylation of cytosolic CaMKIIdelta. Despite normal contractile function and Ca(2+) handling after the training period, phospholamban was hyperphosphorylated at Serine-16. Protein kinase A inhibition (H-89) in cardiomyocytes from the exercised db/db group abolished the differences in SR-Ca(2+) load when compared with the sedentary db/db mice. EC coupling changes were observed without changes in serum insulin or glucose levels, suggesting that the exercise training-induced effects are not via normalization of the diabetic condition.
These data demonstrate that aerobic interval training almost completely restored the contractile function of the diabetic cardiomyocyte to levels close to sedentary wild type.},

abstract = {Droplet interface bilayers are versatile model membranes useful for synthetic biology and biosensing; however, to date they have always been confined to fluid reservoirs. Here, we demonstrate that when two or more water droplets collide on an oil-infused substrate, they exhibit noncoalescence due to the formation of a thin oil film that gets squeezed between the droplets from the bottom up. We show that when phospholipids are included in the water droplets, a stable droplet interface bilayer forms between the noncoalescing water droplets. As with traditional oil-submerged droplet interface bilayers, we were able to characterize ion channel transport by incorporating peptides into each droplet. Our findings reveal that droplet interface bilayers can function in ambient environments, which could potentially enable biosensing of airborne matter.},

abstract = {Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is the Ca2+ dependent switch for contraction in heart muscle making it a potential target for drug research in the therapy of heart failure. Calcium binding on Troponin C (TnC) triggers a series of conformational changes exposing a hydrophobic pocket in the N-domain of TnC (cNTnC), which leads to force generation. Mutations and acidic pH have been related to altering the sensitivity of TnC affecting the efficiency of the heart. Bepridil, identified as a calcium sensitizer to TnC, has been experimentally found to bind to the N-domain pocket of TnC but with negative cooperativity. Screening and de nova design were carried out using LUDI and AUTOLUDI programs in this work to identify and design potential ligands that can bind to the hydrophobic pocket of TnC. Two docking centers and multiple searching radii including 5 angstrom, 5.5 angstrom, 6 angstrom, 6.5 angstrom, 7.0 angstrom and 7.5 angstrom were used in LUDI to screen the ZINC database. Based on the LUDI docking results, 8 molecules were identified from the database with good potential to bind into the binding pocket and they were used as template molecules to generate a series of new molecules by AUTOLUDI design. Out of all the newly-designed molecules, 14 new ligands were recognized to be potential ligands that can bind and fit well into the binding pocket. These molecules can be used as starting molecules to develop TnC ligands. The binding stability and binding affinity of these molecules to the protein was further analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the binding energies, interactions and complex stabilities of 6 ligands are comparable to or better than bepridil.},

abstract = {The mechanism of functional coupling between mitochondrial creatine kinase (MiCK) and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in isolated heart mitochondria is analyzed. Two alternative mechanisms are studied: 1), dynamic compartmentation of ATP and ADP, which assumes the differences in concentrations of the substrates between intermembrane space and surrounding solution due to some diffusion restriction and 2), direct transfer of the substrates between MiCK and ANT. The mathematical models based on these possible mechanisms were composed and simulation results were compared with the available experimental data. The first model, based on a dynamic compartmentation mechanism, was not sufficient to reproduce the measured values of apparent dissociation constants of MiCK reaction coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. The second model, which assumes the direct transfer of substrates between MiCK and ANT, is shown to be in good agreement with experiments-i.e., the second model reproduced the measured constants and the estimated ADP flux, entering mitochondria after the MiCK reaction. This model is thermodynamically consistent, utilizing the free energy profiles of reactions. The analysis revealed the minimal changes in the free energy profile of the MiCK-ANT interaction required to reproduce the experimental data. A possible free energy profile of the coupled MiCK-ANT system is presented.},

abstract = {With scanning confocal microscopy we obtained three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the transverse tubular system (t-system) of rabbit ventricular cells. We accomplished this by labeling the t-system with dextran linked to fluorescein or, alternatively, wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to an Alexa fluor dye. Image processing and visualization techniques allowed us to reconstruct the t-system in three dimensions. In a myocyte lying. at on a coverslip, t-tubules typically progressed from its upper and lower surfaces. 3D reconstructions of the t-tubules also suggested that some of them progressed from the sides of the cell. The analysis of single t-tubules revealed novel morphological features. The average diameter of single t-tubules from six cells was estimated to 448 +/- 172 nm (mean +/- SD, number of t-tubules 348, number of cross sections 5323). From reconstructions we were able to identify constrictions occurring every 1.87 +/- 1.09 mu m along the principal axis of the tubule. The cross-sectional area of these constrictions was reduced to an average of 57.7 +/- 27.5{\%} (number of constrictions 170) of the adjacent local maximal areas. Principal component analysis revealed. attening of t-tubular cross sections, confirming findings that we obtained from electron micrographs. Dextran-and wheat-germ agglutinin-associated signals were correlated in the t-system and are therefore equally good markers. The 3D structure of the t-system in rabbit ventricular myocytes seems to be less complex than that found in rat. Moreover, we found that t-tubules in rabbit have approximately twice the diameter of those in rat. We speculate that the constrictions (or regions between them) are sites of dyadic clefts and therefore can provide geometric markers for colocalizing dyadic proteins. In consideration of the resolution of the imaging system, we suggest that our methods permit us to obtain spatially resolved 3D reconstructions of the t-system in rabbit cells. We also propose that our methods allow us to characterize pathological defects of the t-system, e. g., its remodeling as a result of heart failure.},

@article{Nonner2000,
abstract = {L-type calcium channels are Ca(2+) binding proteins of great biological importance. They generate an essential intracellular signal of living cells by allowing Ca(2+) ions to move across the lipid membrane into the cell, thereby selecting an ion that is in low extracellular abundance. Their mechanism of selection involves four carboxylate groups, containing eight oxygen ions, that belong to the side chains of the "EEEE" locus of the channel protein, a setting similar to that found in many Ca(2+)-chelating molecules. This study examines the hypothesis that selectivity in this locus is determined by mutual electrostatic screening and volume exclusion between ions and carboxylate oxygens of finite diameters. In this model, the eight half-charged oxygens of the tethered carboxylate groups of the protein are confined to a subvolume of the pore (the "filter"), but interact spontaneously with their mobile counterions as ions interact in concentrated bulk solutions. The mean spherical approximation (MSA) is used to predict ion-specific excess chemical potentials in the filter and baths. The theory is calibrated using a single experimental observation, concerning the apparent dissociation constant of Ca(2+) in the presence of a physiological concentration of NaCl. When ions are assigned their independently known crystal diameters and the carboxylate oxygens are constrained, e.g., to a volume of 0.375 nm(3) in an environment with an effective dielectric coefficient of 63.5, the hypothesized selectivity filter produces the shape of the calcium binding curves observed in experiment, and it predicts Ba(2+)/Ca(2+) and Na(+)/Li(+) competition, and Cl(-) exclusion as observed. The selectivities for Na(+), Ca(2+), Ba(2+), other alkali metal ions, and Cl(-) thus can be predicted by volume exclusion and electrostatic screening alone. Spontaneous coordination of ions and carboxylates can produce a wide range of Ca(2+) selectivities, depending on the volume density of carboxylate groups and the permittivity in the locus. A specific three-dimensional structure of atoms at the binding site is not needed to explain Ca(2+) selectivity.},

abstract = {The solution NMR structure is reported for Ca2+-loaded S100B bound to a 12-residue peptide, TRTK-12, from the actin capping protein CapZ (??1- or ??2 subunit, residues 265-276: TRTKIDWNKILS). This peptide was discovered by Dimlich and co-workers by screening a bacteriophage random peptide display library, and it matches exactly the consensus S100B binding sequence ((K/R)(L/I)XWXXIL). As with other S100B target proteins, a calcium-dependent conformational change in S100B is required for TRTK-12 binding. The TRTK-12 peptide is an amphipathic helix (residues W7 to S12) in the S100B-TRTK complex, and helix 4 of S100B is extended by three or four residues upon peptide binding. However, helical TRTK-12 in the S100B-peptide complex is uniquely oriented when compared to the three-dimensional structures of other S100-peptide complexes. The three-dimensional structure of the S100B-TRTK peptide complex illustrates that residues in the S100B binding consensus sequence (K4, I5, W7, I10, L11) are all involved in the S100B-peptide interface, which can explain its orientation in the S100B binding pocket and its relatively high binding affinity. A comparison of the S100B-TRTK peptide structure to the structures of apo- and Ca2+-bound S100B illustrates that the binding site of TRTK-12 is buried in apo-S100B, but is exposed in Ca2+-bound S100B as necessary to bind the TRTK-12 peptide. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Parvalbumin (PV), an EF-hand protein family member, is a delayed calcium buffer that exchanges magnesium for calcium to facilitate fast skeletal muscle relaxation. Genetic approaches that express parvalbumin in the heart also enhance relaxation and show promise of being therapeutic against various cardiac diseases where relaxation is compromised. Unfortunately, skeletal muscle PVs have very slow rates of Ca(2+) dissociation and are prone to becoming saturated with Ca(2+), eventually losing their buffering capability within the constantly beating heart. In order for PV to have a more therapeutic potential in the heart, a PV with faster rates of calcium dissociation and high Mg(2+) affinity is needed. We demonstrate that at 35°C, rat $\beta$-PV has an {\~{}}30-fold faster rate of Ca(2+) dissociation compared to rat skeletal muscle $\alpha$-PV, and still possesses a physiologically relevant Ca(2+) affinity ({\~{}}100 nM). However, rat $\beta$-PV will not be a delayed Ca(2+) buffer since its Mg(2+) affinity is too low ({\~{}}1 mM). We have engineered two mutations into rat $\beta$-PV, S55D and E62D, when observed alone increase Mg(2+) affinity up to fivefold, but when combined increase Mg(2+) affinity {\~{}}13-fold, well within a physiologically relevant affinity. Furthermore, the Mg(2+) dissociation rate (172/s) from the engineered S55D, E62D PV is slow enough for delayed Ca(2+) buffering. Additionally, the engineered PV retains a high Ca(2+) affinity (132 nM) and fast rate of Ca(2+) dissociation (64/s). These PV design strategies hold promise for the development of new therapies to remediate relaxation abnormalities in different heart diseases and heart failure.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) acts as an intracellular calcium sensor that translates the Ca2+ signal into a variety of cellular processes. Ca(2+)-CaM recognition of a short polypeptide segment in target proteins induces conformational changes in both CaM and the target, enabling the target protein to become functionally active. The solution and crystal structures of Ca(2+)-CaM bound to peptides derived from three CaM-dependent enzymes reveal structural features that are common in target recognition by Ca(2+)-CaM. Phosphorylation of the target proteins at sites in or near the CaM-binding region modulates binding of CaM, thereby providing an additional mechanism of functional regulation. The structural aspects of target recognition by Ca(2+)-CaM are discussed using mainly the three-dimensional structural information obtained with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction methods.},

abstract = {Orchestrated excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle requires adequate spatial arrangement of systems responsible for ion movement and metabolite turnover. Co-localization of regulatory and transporting proteins into macromolecular complexes within an environment of microanatomical cell components raises intracellular diffusion barriers that hamper the mobility of metabolites and signaling molecules. Compared to substrate diffusion in the cytosol, diffusional restrictions underneath the sarcolemma are much larger and could impede ion and nucleotide movement by a factor of 10(3)-10(5). Diffusion barriers thus seclude metabolites within the submembrane space enabling rapid and vectorial effector targeting, yet hinder energy supply from the bulk cytosolic space implicating the necessity for a shunting transfer mechanism. Here, we address principles of membrane protein compartmentation, phosphotransfer enzyme-facilitated interdomain energy transfer, and nucleotide signal dynamics at the subsarcolemma-cytosol interface. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Local Signaling in Myocytes".

Recent years have brought major advances in our understanding of microglial Ca(2+) signaling.

The literature has grown rapidly during the past few years, especially in regard to chemokine and ATP/UTP receptor signaling. This article presents a brief overview of the basics of Ca(2+) signaling, reviews the current literature on microglial Ca(2+) signaling, and discusses the current challenges and possible future directions of this emerging field.},

abstract = {It would often be useful in computer simulations to use a simple description of solvation effects, instead of explicitly representing the individual solvent molecules. Continuum dielectric models often work well in describing the thermodynamic aspects of aqueous solvation, and approximations to such models that avoid the need to solve the Poisson equation are attractive because of their computational efficiency. Here we give an overview of one such approximation, the generalized Born model, which is simple and fast enough to be used for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. We discuss its strengths and weaknesses, both for its fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for its ability to replace explicit consideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations. We focus particularly on versions of the generalized Born model that have a pair-wise analytical form, and therefore fit most naturally into conventional molecular mechanics calculations.},

abstract = {The DOCK program explores possible orientations of a molecule within a macromolecular active site by superimposing atoms precomputed site points. Here we compare a number of different search methods, including an exhaustive matching algorithm based on a single docking graph. We evaluate the performance of each method by screening a small database of molecules to a variety of macromolecular targets. By varying the amount of sampling, we can monitor the time convergence of scores and ranking. We not only show that the site point directed search is tenfold faster than a random search, but that the single graph matching algorithum boosts the speed of database screening up to 60-fold. The new algorithum, in fact, outperforms the bipartite graph matching algorithum currently used in DOCK. The results indicate that a critical issue for rapid database screening is the extent to which a search method biases run time toward the highest-ranking molecules. The single docking group matching algorithum will be incorporated into DOCK version 4.0.},

abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase segment extending from the phosphorylation site (Asp-351) to the preceding transmembrane helix M4 (which is involved in Ca2+ binding in conjunction with transmembrane helices M5, M6, and M8) retains a marked sequence homology to the corresponding segments of other cation ATPases. We made 26 point mutations in this segment and found that nonconservative mutations of residues that are homologous in various cation ATPases result in strong inhibition of catalytic and transport function. Mutations of nonhomologous residues to match the corresponding residues of other cation ATPases are not inhibitory and, in some cases, produce higher activity. The inhibitory mutations affect the phosphorylated intermediate turnover, which is associated with the vectorial translocation of bound Ca2+. The same mutations do not affect the kinetics of ATPase activation by Ca2+ following enzyme preincubation with EGTA. This suggests that activation of the phosphoryl transfer reaction by Ca2+ binding and vectorial displacement of bound Ca2+ by enzyme phosphorylation do not occur simply as the forward and reverse directions of the same process, but are linked to distinct structural features of the enzyme. The peptide segment extending from the phosphorylation site in the enzyme extramembranous headpiece through the M4 helix in the membrane-bound region sustains a prominent role in transmission of the phosphorylation signal for displacement of bound Ca2+. A critical structural role of this segment is also demonstrated by the interference of specific mutations with membrane assembly of the expressed protein.},

X-ray crystallography of several viruses in this category has provided tantalizing glimpses of portions of the packaged nucleic acid, contributing crucial information on how the genome might be folded within the virion. This information combined with theoretical considerations and data from molecular approaches suggests mechanisms by which coat proteins interact with genomic RNA to shape it into a conformation that is compatible with the geometry of the virion.

On the other hand, treatment of SR with PLN AB (which mimics the effect of PLN phosphorylation by uncoupling Ca2+-ATPase from PLN) resulted in similar to 2-fold decrease in k(0.5) for Ca2+ without any change in V-max of Ca2+ sequestration. These findings suggest that, besides PLN phosphorylation, direct phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase by SR-associated CaM kinase serves to enhance the speed of cardiac muscle relaxation, (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

@article{Lim2008,
abstract = {Troponin C (TnC) belongs to the superfamily of EF-hand (helix-loop-helix) Ca(2+)-binding proteins and is an essential component of the regulatory thin filament complex. In a patient diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, we identified two novel missense mutations localized in the regulatory Ca(2+)-binding Site II of TnC, TnC((E59D,D75Y)). Expression of recombinant TnC((E59D,D75Y)) in isolated rat cardiomyocytes induced a marked decrease in contractility despite normal intracellular calcium homeostasis in intact cardiomyocytes and resulted in impaired myofilament calcium responsiveness in Triton-permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Expression of the individual mutants in cardiomyocytes showed that TnC(D75Y) was able to recapitulate the TnC((E59D,D75Y)) phenotype, whereas TnC(E59D) was functionally benign. Force-pCa relationships in TnC((E59D,D75Y)) reconstituted rabbit psoas fibers and fluorescence spectroscopy of TnC((E59D,D75Y)) labeled with 2-[(4'-iodoacetamide)-aniline]naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid showed a decrease in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and Ca(2+) binding affinity, respectively. Furthermore, computational analysis of TnC showed the Ca(2+)-binding pocket as an active region of concerted motions, which are decreased markedly by mutation D75Y. We conclude that D75Y interferes with proper concerted motions within the regulatory Ca(2+)-binding pocket of TnC that hinders the relay of the thin filament calcium signal, thereby providing a primary stimulus for impaired cardiomyocyte contractility. This in turn may trigger pathways leading to aberrant ventricular remodeling and ultimately a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype.},

multiple It$\backslash${\^{}}{\{}o{\}}-Wiener integral type, subject to suitable assumptions on the

{\$}u,v{\$} are dependent on the interactions present within the system, we employ a
certain stochastic decoupling method to tackle this components dependence. The
time-fractional system is also considered, in which the Mittag-Leffler function
is used.},

@article{Bond1993,
abstract = {Ischemia is characterized by anoxia and a large decrease of tissue pH. After a critical period of ischemia, reperfusion precipitates irreversible injury. Previous work showed that reperfusion injury to cultured neonatal myocytes was precipitated by a rapid return to physiological pH, a "pH paradox" (Bond, J., B. Herman, and J. Lemasters. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 179: 798-803, 1991). The aim of this study was to measure intracellular pH (pHi) and cytosolic free Ca2+ during the pH paradox of reperfusion injury to cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. pHi and free Ca2+ were measured by ratio imaging of 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein and fura 2 fluorescence. To simulate ATP depletion and acidosis of ischemia, myocytes were incubated with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose plus 2.5 mM NaCN at pH 6.2. During simulated ischemia, pHi dropped to {\textless} 6.5 and subsequently remained constant. During this time, some blebbing but little hypercontraction occurred. After 3 or 4 h of simulated ischemia, inhibitors were removed and cells were incubated at pH 7.4 to simulate reperfusion. pHi began to increase, blebbing accelerated, and myocytes hypercontracted. As pHi increased, viability was lost. The same occurred if pH was increased but metabolic inhibitors were not removed. Monensin, a Na(+)-H+ ionophore, accelerated the increase of pH after reperfusion and hastened cell killing. Hypercontraction, blebbing, and loss of viability did not occur when inhibitors were removed at pH 6.2 or in the presence of dimethylamiloride, an inhibitor of Na(+)-H+ exchange. Protection was associated with maintenance of an acidotic pHi. Free Ca2+ progressively increased during simulated ischemia. After simulated reperfusion, free Ca2+ increased further.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {In this essay I will sketch some ideas for how to think about models in biology. I will begin by trying to dispel the myth that quantitative modeling is somehow foreign to biology. I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as 'predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

@article{Smyrnias2010,
abstract = {Narrow, tubular, inward projections of the sarcolemma ('T-tubules') are an established feature of adult mammalian ventricular myocytes that enables them to generate the whole-cell Ca2+ transients and produce coordinated contraction. Loss of T-tubules can occur during ageing and under pathological conditions, leading to altered cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. In contrast to adult ventricular cells, atrial myocytes do not generally express an extensive T-tubule system at any stage of development, and therefore rely on Ca2+ channels around their periphery for the induction of Ca2+ signalling and excitation-contraction coupling. Consequently, the characteristics of systolic Ca2+ signals in adult ventricular and atrial myocytes are temporally and spatially distinct. However, although atrial myocytes do not have the same regularly spaced convoluted T-tubule structures as adult ventricular cells, it has been suggested that a proportion of adult atrial cells have a more rudimentary tubule system. We examined the structure and function of these atrial tubules, and explored their impact on the initiation and recovery of Ca2+ signalling in electrically paced myocytes. The atrial responses were compared to those in adult ventricular cells that had intact T-tubules, or that had been chemically detubulated. We found that tubular structures were present in a significant minority of adult atrial myocytes, and were unlike the T-tubules in adult ventricular cells. In those cells where they were present, the atrial tubules significantly altered the on-set, amplitude, homogeneity and recovery of Ca2+ transients. The properties of adult atrial myocyte Ca2+ signals were different from those in adult ventricular cells, whether intact or detubulated. Excitation-contraction coupling in detubulated adult ventricular myocytes, therefore, does not approximate to atrial signalling, even though Ca2+ signals are initiated in the periphery of the cells in both of these situations. Furthermore, inotropic responses to endothelin-1 were entirely dependent on T-tubules in adult ventricular myocytes, but not in atrial cells. Our data reveal that that the T-tubules in atrial cells impart significant functional properties, but loss of these tubular membranes does not affect Ca2+ signalling as dramatically as detubulation in ventricular myocytes.

abstract = {Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). We use solution NMR to map the structural changes occurring within SLN upon interaction with the regulatory target, SERCA, co-reconstituting the two proteins in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) detergent micelles, a system that preserves the native structure of SLN and the activity of SERCA, with the goal of comparing these interactions with those of the previously studied PLN-SERCA complex. Our analysis of the structural dynamics of SLN in DPC micelles shows this polypeptide to be partitioned into four subdomains: a short unstructured N terminus (residues 1-6), a short dynamic helix (residues 7-14), a more rigid helix (residues 15-26), and an unstructured C terminus (residues 27-31). Upon addition of SERCA, the different domains behave according to their dynamics, molding onto the surface of the enzyme. Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms.},

@article{Satoh2011,
abstract = {Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is an intracellular Ca2+ pump localized on the SR/ER membrane. The role of SERCA in refilling intracellular Ca2+ stores is pivotal for maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and disturbed SERCA activity causes many disease phenotypes, including heart failure, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. Although SERCA activity has been described using a simple enzyme activity equation, the dynamics of SERCA activity in living cells is still unknown. To monitor SERCA activity in living cells, we constructed an enhanced CFP (ECFP)- and FlAsH-tagged SERCA2a, designated F-L577, which retains the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump activity. The FRET efficiency between ECFP and FlAsH of F-L577 is dependent on the conformational state of the molecule. ER luminal Ca2+ imaging confirmed that the FRET signal changes directly reflect the Ca2+ pump activity. Dual imaging of cytosolic Ca2+ and the FRET signals of F-L577 in intact COS7 cells revealed that SERCA2a activity is coincident with the oscillatory cytosolic Ca2+ concentration changes evoked by ATP stimulation. The Ca2+ pump activity of SERCA2a in intact cells can be expressed by the Hill equation with an apparent affinity for Ca2+ of 0.41 +/- 0.0095 +/- mu M and a Hill coefficient of 5.7 +/- 0.73. These results indicate that in the cellular environment the Ca2+ dependence of ATPase activation is highly cooperative and that SERCA2a acts as a rapid switch to refill Ca2+ stores in living cells for shaping the intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. F-L577 will be useful for future studies on Ca2+ signaling involving SERCA2a activity.},

abstract = {The mechanism of water permeation across the sarcolemma was characterized by examining the kinetics and temperature dependence of osmotic swelling and shrinkage of rabbit ventricular myocytes. The magnitude of swelling and the kinetics of swelling and shrinkage were temperature dependent, but the magnitude of shrinkage was very similar at 6 degrees, 22 degrees, and 37 degrees C. Membrane hydraulic conductivity, Lp, was approximately 1.2 x 10(-10) liter.N-1.s-1 at 22 degrees C, corresponding to an osmotic permeability coefficient, Pf, of 16 microns.s-1, and was independent of the direction of water flux, the magnitude of the imposed osmotic gradient (35-165 mosm/liter), and the initial cell volume. This value of Lp represents an upper limit because the membrane was assumed to be a smooth surface. Based on capacitive membrane area, Lp was 0.7 to 0.9 x 10(-10) liter.N-1.s-1. Nevertheless, estimates of Lp in ventricle are 15 to 25 times lower than those in human erythrocytes and are in the range of values reported for protein-free lipid bilayers and biological membranes without functioning water channels (aquaporin). Evaluation of the effect of unstirred layers showed that in the worst case they decrease Lp by  or = 2.3{\%}. Analysis of the temperature dependence of Lp indicated that its apparent Arrhenius activation energy, Ea', was 11.7 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol between 6 degrees and 22 degrees C and 9.2 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol between 22 degrees and 37 degrees C. These values are significantly greater than that typically found for water flow through water-filled pores, approximately 4 kcal/mol, and are in the range reported for artificial and natural membranes without functioning water channels. Taken together, these data strongly argue that the vast majority of osmotic water flux in ventricular myocytes penetrates the lipid bilayer itself rather than passing through water-filled pores.},

abstract = {There has been a long history of interaction between mathematics and physiology. This book looks in detail at a wide selection of mathematical models in physiology, showing how physiological problems can be formulated and studied mathematically, and how such models give rise to interesting and challenging mathematical questions. With its coverage of many recent models it gives an overview of the field, while many older models are also discussed, to put the modern work in context. In this second edition the coverage of basic principles has been expanded to include such topics as stochastic differential equations, Markov models and Gibbs free energy, and the selection of models has also been expanded to include some of the basic models of fluid transport, respiration/perfusion, blood diseases, molecular motors, smooth muscle, neuroendrocine cells, the baroreceptor loop, turboglomerular oscillations, blood clotting and the retina. Owing to this extensive coverage, the seond edition is published in two volumes. This first volume deals with the fundamental principles of cell physiology and the second with the physiology of systems. The book includes detailed illustrations and numerous excercises with selected solutions. The emphasis throughout is on the applications; because of this interdisciplinary approach, this book will be of interest to students and researchers, not only in mathematics, but also in bioengineering, physics, chemistry, biology, statistics and medicine. James Keener is a Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the University of Utah. James Sneyd is the Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. He is best known for his work on the dynamics of intracellular calcium. Reviews of the first edition: ...probably the best book ever written on the interdisciplinary field of mathematical physiology. Mathematical Reviews, 2000 In addition to being good reading, excellent pedagogy, and appealing science, the exposition is lucid and clear, and there are many good problem sets to choose from... Highly recommended. Mathematical Biosciences, 1999 Both authors are seasoned experts in the field of mathematical physiology and particularly in the field of excitability, calcium dynamics and spiral waves. It directs students to become not merely skilled technicians in biological research but masters of the science.

@article{Grant2011,
abstract = {The minimum motor domain of kinesin-1 is a single head. Recent evidence suggests that such minimal motor domains generate force by a biased binding mechanism, in which they preferentially select binding sites on the microtubule that lie ahead in the progress direction of the motor. A specific molecular mechanism for biased binding has, however, so far been lacking. Here we use atomistic Brownian dynamics simulations combined with experimental mutagenesis to show that incoming kinesin heads undergo electrostatically guided diffusion-to-capture by microtubules, and that this produces directionally biased binding. Kinesin-1 heads are initially rotated by the electrostatic field so that their tubulin-binding sites face inwards, and then steered towards a plus-endwards binding site. In tethered kinesin dimers, this bias is amplified. A 3-residue sequence (RAK) in kinesin helix alpha-6 is predicted to be important for electrostatic guidance. Real-world mutagenesis of this sequence powerfully influences kinesin-driven microtubule sliding, with one mutant producing a 5-fold acceleration over wild type. We conclude that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the kinesin stepping mechanism, by biasing the diffusional association of kinesin with microtubules.},

Soc. 1990, 112, 6127−9) to calculate ligand−receptor binding energies. The GB/SA approach allows for the estimation of electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrophobic contributions to the free energy of binding. The GB/SA formulation provides a good balance between computational speed and accuracy in these calculations. We have derived a formula to estimate the binding free energy. We have also developed a procedure to penalize any unoccupied embedded space that might form between the ligand and the receptor during the docking process. To improve the computational speed, the protein contribution to the electrostatic screening is precalculated and stored on a grid. Refinement...},

Wherever possible, we used Markov models to represent the molecular structure and function of ion channels. The model includes detailed intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, with simulations of localized events such as sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release into a small intracellular volume bounded by the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Transporter-mediated Ca2+ fluxes from the bulk cytosol are closely matched to the experimentally reported values and predict stimulation rate-dependent changes in Ca2+ transients. Our model reproduces the properties of cardiac myocytes from two different regions of the heart: the apex and the septum. The septum has a relatively prolonged AP, which reflects a relatively small contribution from the rapid transient outward K+ current in the septum. The attribution of putative molecular bases for several of the component currents enables our mouse model to be used to simulate the behavior of genetically modified transgenic mice.},

abstract = {Cardiac contraction and relaxation are regulated by conformational transitions of protein complexes that are responsible for calcium trafficking through cell membranes. Central to the muscle relaxation phase is a dynamic membrane protein complex formed by Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN), which in humans is responsible for similar to 70{\%} of the calcium re-uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Dysfunction in this regulatory mechanism causes severe pathophysiologies. In this report, we used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, and coupled enzyme assays to investigate how single mutations at position 21 of PLN affects its structural dynamics and, in turn, its interaction with SERCA. We found that it is possible to control the activity of SERCA by tuning PLN structural dynamics. Both increased rigidity and mobility of the PLN backbone cause a reduction of SERCA inhibition, affecting calcium transport. Although the more rigid, loss-of-function (LOF) mutants have lower binding affinities for SERCA, the more dynamic LOF mutants have binding affinities similar to that of PLN. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to harness this knowledge to design new LOF mutants with activity similar to S16E (a mutant already used in gene therapy) for possible application in recombinant gene therapy. As proof of concept, we show a new mutant of PLN, P21G, with improved LOF characteristics in vitro.},

A wealth of studies has been carried out on the structure of CaM, both in the unliganded form and in complexes with target proteins and peptides. The outcome of these studies points toward a high propensity to attain various conformational states, depending on the binding partner. The purpose of this review is to provide examples of different conformations of CaM trapped in the crystal state. In addition, comparisons are made to corresponding studies in solution. The different CaM conformations in crystal structures are also compared based on the positions of the metal ions bound to their EF hands, in terms of distances, angles, and pseudo-torsion angles. Possible caveats and artifacts in CaM crystal structures are discussed, as well as the possibilities of trapping biologically relevant CaM conformations in the crystal state.},

abstract = {An extended accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) methodology called adaptive AMD is presented. Adaptive AMD (Ad AMD) is an efficient and robust conformational space sampling algorithm that is particularly-well suited to proteins with highly structured potential energy surfaces exhibiting complex large scale collective conformational transitions. Ad-AMD simulations of substrate-free P450cam reveal that this system exists in equilibrium between a fully and partially open conformational state. The mechanism for substrate binding depends on the size of the ligand. Larger ligands enter the P450cam binding pocket, and the resulting substrate-bound system is trapped in an open conformation via a population shift mechanism. Small ligands, which fully enter the binding pocket, cause an induced-fit mechanism, resulting in the formation of an energetically stable closed conformational state. These results are corroborated by recent experimental studies and potentially provide detailed insight into the functional dynamics and conformational behaviour of the entire cytochrome-P450 super family.},

abstract = {Myosin cross-bridges play an important role in the regulation of thin-filament activation in cardiac muscle. To test the hypothesis that sarcomere length (SL) modulation of thin-filament activation by strong-binding cross-bridges underlies the Frank-Starling mechanism, we inhibited force and strong cross-bridge binding to intermediate levels with sodium vanadate (Vi). Force and stiffness varied proportionately with [Ca2+] and [Vi]. Increasing [Vi] (decreased force) reduced the pCa(50) Of force-[Ca2+] relations at 2.3 and 2.0 mu m SL, with little effect on slope (n(H)). When maximum force was inhibited to similar to 40{\%}, the effects of SL on force were diminished at lower [Ca2+], whereas at higher [Ca2+] (pCa {\textless} 5.6) the relative influence of SL on force increased. In contrast, force inhibition to similar to 20{\%} significantly reduced the sensitivity of force-[Ca2+] relations to changes in both SL and myofilament lattice spacing. Strong cross-bridge binding cooperatively induced changes in cardiac troponin C structure, as measured by dichroism of 5' iodoacetamido-tetramethylrhodamine-labeled cardiac troponin C. This apparent cooperativity was reduced at shorter SL. These data emphasize that SL and/or myofilament lattice spacing modulation of the cross-bridge component of cardiac thin-filament activation contributes to the Frank-Starling mechanism.},

abstract = {Restriction endonucleases such as EcoRI bind and cleave DNA with great specificity and represent a paradigm for protein-DNA interactions and molecular recognition. Using osmotic pressure to induce water release, we demonstrate the participation of bound waters in the sequence discrimination of substrate DNA by EcoRI. Changes in solvation can play a critical role in directing sequence-specific DNA binding by EcoRI and are also crucial in assisting site discrimination during catalysis. By measuring the volume change for complex formation, we show that at the cognate sequence (GAATTC) EcoRI binding releases about 70 fewer water molecules than binding at an alternate DNA sequence (TAATTC), which differs by a single base pair. EcoRI complexation with nonspecific DNA releases substantially less water than either of these specific complexes. In cognate substrates (GAATTC) kcat decreases as osmotic pressure is increased, indicating the binding of about 30 water molecules accompanies the cleavage reaction. For the alternate substrate (TAATTC), release of about 40 water molecules accompanies the reaction, indicated by a dramatic acceleration of the rate when osmotic pressure is raised. These large differences in solvation effects demonstrate that water molecules can be key players in the molecular recognition process during both association and catalytic phases of the EcoRI reaction, acting to change the specificity of the enzyme. For both the protein-DNA complex and the transition state, there may be substantial conformational differences between cognate and alternate sites, accompanied by significant alterations in hydration and solvent accessibility.},

abstract = {The association of two proteins is bounded by the rate at which they, via diffusion, find each other while in appropriate relative orientations. Orientational constraints restrict this rate to approximately 10(5)-10(6) M(-1) s(-1). Proteins with higher association rates generally have complementary electrostatic surfaces; proteins with lower association rates generally are slowed down by conformational changes upon complex formation. Previous studies (Zhou, Biophys J 1997;73:2441-2445) have shown that electrostatic enhancement of the diffusion-limited association rate can be accurately modeled by {\$}k{\_}{\{}\backslashbf D{\}}{\$} = {\$}k{\_}{\{}D{\}}0\backslash {\{}exp{\}} ( - \backslashlangle U{\_}{\{}el{\}} \backslashrangle;{\{}\backslashstar{\}}/k{\_}{\{}B{\}} T),{\$} where k(D) and k(D0) are the rates in the presence and absence of electrostatic interactions, respectively, U(el) is the average electrostatic interaction energy in a "transient-complex" ensemble, and k(B)T is the thermal energy. The transient-complex ensemble separates the bound state from the unbound state. Predictions of the transient-complex theory on four protein complexes were found to agree well with the experiment when the electrostatic interaction energy was calculated with the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation (Alsallaq and Zhou, Structure 2007;15:215-224). Here we show that the agreement is further improved when the nonlinear PB equation is used. These predictions are obtained with the dielectric boundary defined as the protein van der Waals surface. When the dielectric boundary is instead specified as the molecular surface, electrostatic interactions in the transient complex become repulsive and are thus predicted to retard association. Together these results demonstrate that the transient-complex theory is predictive of electrostatic rate enhancement and can help parameterize PB calculations.},

@article{Trafford1995,
abstract = {1. The aim of these experiments was to compare the time course of changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) measured in the bulk cytoplasm with those estimated to occur near the sarcolemma. Sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange current and [Ca2+](i) were measured in single, voltage-clamped ventricular myocytes.2. Spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) resulted in a transient inward current. This current developed and decayed more quickly than the accompanying changes in [Ca2+](i) (measured with indo-1) resulting in a hysteresis between [Ca2+](i) and current. A similar hysteresis was also observed if [Ca2+](i) was elevated with caffeine and was removed if the current was low pass filtered with a time constant of 132 ms.3. Digital video imaging (using flue-3 or calcium green-1 to measure [Ca2+](i)) allowed measurement of [Ca2+](i) at all points in the cell during the wave of spontaneous Ca2+ release. The hysteresis between [Ca2+](i) and current remained, even after allowing for the spatial and temporal properties of this wave.4. The hysteresis can be accounted for if there is a barrier to diffusion of Ca2+ ions separating the bulk cytoplasm from the space under the sarcolemma (into which Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum). The calculated subsarcolemmal [Ca2+] rises and falls more quickly (and reaches a higher peak) than does the bulk [Ca2+]. The delay introduced by this barrier is equivalent to a time constant of 133 ms.5. The subsarcolemmal space described in this paper may be equivalent to the 'fuzzy space' previously suggested to be important in controlling SR Ca2+ release.},

abstract = {Cardiac diseases associated with mutations in Tn subunits include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Altered calcium handling in these diseases is evidenced by changes in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction. Mutations in the Ca(2+) sensor, Troponin C (TnC) were generated to increase / decrease the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac skinned fibers in order to create the characteristic effects of DCM, HCM and RCM. We also used a reconstituted assay to determine the mutations effects on ATPase activation and inhibition. One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition). Three mutants (S37G, V44Q, L48Q) were identified with RCM-like properties (a large increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity, partial loss of ATPase inhibition and increased basal force). Two mutations were identified (E40A, I61Q) with DCM properties (decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force recovery and activation of the ATPase at high [Ca(2+)]). Steady-state fluorescence was utilized to assess Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cTnCs containing F27W and did not necessarily mirror the fiber Ca(2+) sensitivity. Circular dichroism (CD) of mutant cTnCs revealed a trend where increased alpha-helical content correlated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers and vice versa. The main findings from this study were: 1) cTnC mutants demonstrated distinct functional phenotypes reminiscent of bona fide HCM, RCM and DCM mutations 2) identification of a region in cTnC associated with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity in skinned fibers and 3) the F27W reporter mutation affected Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force and ATPase activation of some mutants.},

Here we discuss our recent experience with this model, presenting in detail the way it is implemented and parallelized in the AMBER molecular modeling code. We compare results using the GB model (or GB plus a surface-area based hydrophobic term) to explicit solvent simulations for a 10 base-pair DNA oligomer, and for the 108-residue protein thioredoxin. A slight modification of our earlier suggested parameters makes the GB results more like those found in explicit solvent, primarily by slightly increasing the strength of NH [bond] O and NH [bond] N internal hydrogen bonds. Timing and energy stability results are reported, with an eye toward using these model for simulations of larger macromolecular systems and longer time scales.},

@article{Tseng2001,
abstract = {Cell morphology is controlled by the actin cytoskeleton organization and mechanical properties, which are regulated by the available contents in actin and actin regulatory proteins. Using rheometry and the recently developed multiple-particle tracking method, we compare the mechanical properties and microheterogeneity of actin filament networks containing the F-actin cross-linking protein @a-actinin. The elasticity of F-actin/@a-actinin networks increases with actin concentration more rapidly for a fixed molar ratio of actin to @a-actinin than in the absence of @a-actinin, for networks of fixed @a-actinin concentration and of fixed actin concentration, but more slowly than theoretically predicted for a homogeneous cross-linked semiflexible polymer network. These rheological measurements are complemented by multiple-particle tracking of fluorescent microspheres imbedded in the networks. The distribution of the mean squared displacements of these microspheres becomes progressively more asymmetric and wider for increasing concentration in @a-actinin and, to a lesser extent, for increasing actin concentration, which suggests that F-actin networks become progressively heterogeneous for increasing protein content. This may explain the slower-than-predicted rise in elasticity of F-actin/@a-actinin networks. Together these in vitro results suggest that actin and @a-actinin provides the cell with an unsuspected range of regulatory pathways to modulate its cytoskeleton's micromechanics and local organization in vivo.},

abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase transports two Ca(2+) per ATP hydrolyzed from the cytoplasm to the lumen against a large concentration gradient. During transport, the pump alters the affinity and accessibility for Ca(2+) by rearrangements of transmembrane helices. In this study, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed for wild-type Ca(2+)-ATPase in the Ca(2+)-bound form and the Gln mutants of Glu771 and Glu908. Both of them contribute only one carboxyl oxygen to site I Ca(2+), but only Glu771Gln completely looses the Ca(2+)-binding ability. The simulations show that: (i) For Glu771Gln, but not Glu908Gln, coordination of Ca(2+) was critically disrupted. (ii) Coordination broke at site II first, although Glu771 and Glu908 only contribute to site I. (iii) A water molecule bound to site I Ca(2+) and hydrogen bonded to Glu771 in wild-type, drastically changed the coordination of Ca(2+) in the mutant. (iv) Water molecules flooded the binding sites from the lumenal side. (v) The side chain conformation of Ile775, located at the head of a hydrophobic cluster near the lumenal surface, appears critical for keeping out bulk water. Thus the simulations highlight the importance of the water molecule bound to site I Ca(2+) and point to a strong relationship between Ca(2+)-coordination and shielding of bulk water, providing insights into the mechanism of gating of ion pathways in cation pumps.},

abstract = {We describe here the first three-dimensional structure of the cardiac L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) purified from bovine heart. The structure was determined by electron microscopy and single particle analysis of negatively stained complexes, using the angular reconstitution method. The cardiac VGCC can be isolated as a stable dimer, as reported previously for the skeletal muscle VGCC, with a central aqueous chamber formed by the two halves of the complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dimeric cardiac VGCC binds the dihydropyridine [3H]azidopine with a Kd approximately 310 pM. We have compared the cardiac VGCC structure with the skeletal muscle form, determined using the same reconstructive methodology, allowing us to identify common and distinct features of the complexes. By using antibody and lectin-gold labeling, we have localized the intracellular beta polypeptides and the extracellular glycosylation sites of the skeletal muscle VGCC, which can be correlated to the cardiac three-dimensional structure. From the data presented here the assignment of the orientation of the VGCC complexes with respect to the lipid bilayer is now possible. A difference between the cardiac and skeletal muscle ion channels is apparent in the putative transmembrane region, which would be consistent with the absence of the gamma subunit in the cardiac VGCC assembly.},

abstract = {Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by reduced cardiac contractility independent of vascular disease. A contributor to contractile dysfunction in the diabetic heart is impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum function with reduced sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) pump activity, leading to disturbed intracellular calcium handling. It is currently unclear whether increasing SERCA2a activity in hearts with existing diabetic cardiomyopathy could still improve calcium flux and contractile performance. To test this hypothesis, we generated a cardiac-specific tetracycline-inducible double transgenic mouse, which allows for doxycycline (DOX)-based inducible SERCA2a expression in which DOX exposure turns on SERCA2a expression. Isolated cardiomyocytes and Langendorff perfused hearts from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were studied. Our results show that total SERCA2a protein levels were decreased in the diabetic mice by 60{\%} compared with control. SERCA2a increased above control values in the diabetic mice after DOX. Dysfunctional contractility in the diabetic cardiomyocyte was restored to normal by induction of SERCA2a expression. Calcium transients from diabetic cardiomyocytes showed a delayed rate of diastolic calcium decay of 66{\%}, which was reverted toward normal after SERCA2a expression induced by DOX. Global cardiac function assessed in the diabetic perfused heart showed diminished left ventricular pressure, rate of contraction, and relaxation. These parameters were returned to control values by SERCA2a expression. In conclusion, we have used mice allowing for inducible expression of SERCA2a and could demonstrate that increased expression of SERCA2a leads to improved cardiac function in mice with an already established diabetic cardiomyopathy in absence of detrimental effects.},

@article{Gordon2000,
abstract = {Ca(2+) regulation of contraction in vertebrate striated muscle is exerted primarily through effects on the thin filament, which regulate strong cross-bridge binding to actin. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the position of tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn) on the thin filament determines the interaction of myosin with the binding sites on actin. These binding sites can be characterized as blocked (unable to bind to cross bridges), closed (able to weakly bind cross bridges), or open (able to bind cross bridges so that they subsequently isomerize to become strongly bound and release ATP hydrolysis products). Flexibility of the Tm may allow variability in actin (A) affinity for myosin along the thin filament other than through a single 7 actin:1 tropomyosin:1 troponin (A(7)TmTn) regulatory unit. Tm position on the actin filament is regulated by the occupancy of NH-terminal Ca(2+) binding sites on TnC, conformational changes resulting from Ca(2+) binding, and changes in the interactions among Tn, Tm, and actin and as well as by strong S1 binding to actin. Ca(2+) binding to TnC enhances TnC-TnI interaction, weakens TnI attachment to its binding sites on 1-2 actins of the regulatory unit, increases Tm movement over the actin surface, and exposes myosin-binding sites on actin previously blocked by Tm. Adjacent Tm are coupled in their overlap regions where Tm movement is also controlled by interactions with TnT. TnT also interacts with TnC-TnI in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. All these interactions may vary with the different protein isoforms. The movement of Tm over the actin surface increases the open probability of myosin binding sites on actins so that some are in the open configuration available for myosin binding and cross-bridge isomerization to strong binding, force-producing states. In skeletal muscle, strong binding of cycling cross bridges promotes additional Tm movement. This movement effectively stabilizes Tm in the open position and allows cooperative activation of additional actins in that and possibly neighboring A(7)TmTn regulatory units. The structural and biochemical findings support the physiological observations of steady-state and transient mechanical behavior. Physiological studies suggest the following. 1) Ca(2+) binding to Tn/Tm exposes sites on actin to which myosin can bind. 2) Ca(2+) regulates the strong binding of M.ADP.P(i) to actin, which precedes the production of force (and/or shortening) and release of hydrolysis products. 3) The initial rate of force development depends mostly on the extent of Ca(2+) activation of the thin filament and myosin kinetic properties but depends little on the initial force level. 4) A small number of strongly attached cross bridges within an A(7)TmTn regulatory unit can activate the actins in one unit and perhaps those in neighboring units. This results in additional myosin binding and isomerization to strongly bound states and force production. 5) The rates of the product release steps per se (as indicated by the unloaded shortening velocity) early in shortening are largely independent of the extent of thin filament activation ([Ca(2+)]) beyond a given baseline level. However, with a greater extent of shortening, the rates depend on the activation level. 6) The cooperativity between neighboring regulatory units contributes to the activation by strong cross bridges of steady-state force but does not affect the rate of force development. 7) Strongly attached, cycling cross bridges can delay relaxation in skeletal muscle in a cooperative manner. 8) Strongly attached and cycling cross bridges can enhance Ca(2+) binding to cardiac TnC, but influence skeletal TnC to a lesser extent. 9) Different Tn subunit isoforms can modulate the cross-bridge detachment rate as shown by studies with mutant regulatory proteins in myotubes and in in vitro motility assays.

For the TRTK-12 complexes, the Ca(2+)-binding affinity to wild type ((WT+TRTK)K(D)=12±10 $\mu$M) and the EF2 mutants was increased by 5- to 14-fold versus in the absence of target ((D61N+TRTK)K(D)=29±1.2 $\mu$M, (D63N+TRTK)K(D)=10±2.2 $\mu$M, (D65N+TRTK)K(D)=73±4.4 $\mu$M, and (E72A+TRTK)K(D)=18±3.7 $\mu$M). In addition, R(ex), as measured using relaxation dispersion for side-chain (15)N resonances of Asn63 ((D63N)S100B), was reduced upon TRTK-12 binding when measured by NMR. Likewise, backbone motions on multiple timescales (picoseconds to milliseconds) throughout wild type, (D61N)S100B, (D63N)S100B, and (D65N)S100B were lowered upon binding TRTK-12. However, the X-ray structures of Ca(2+)-bound (2.0{\AA}) and TRTK-bound (1.2{\AA}) (D63N)S100B showed no change in Ca(2+) coordination; thus, these and analogous structural data for the wild-type protein could not be used to explain how target binding increased Ca(2+)-binding affinity in solution. Therefore, a model for how S100B-TRTK-12 complex formation increases Ca(2+) binding is discussed, which considers changes in protein dynamics upon binding the target TRTK-12.

abstract = {Calcium (Ca2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in cardiac myocytes exhibits high gain and is graded. These properties result from local control of Ca2+ release. Existing local control models of Ca2+ release in which interactions between L-Type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (RyRs) are simulated stochastically are able to reconstruct these properties, but only at high computational cost. Here we present a general analytical approach for deriving simplified models of local control of CICR, consisting of low-dimensional systems of coupled ordinary differential equations, from these more complex local control models in which LCC-RyR interactions are simulated stochastically. The resulting model, referred to as the coupled LCC-RyR gating model, successfully reproduces a range of experimental data, including L-Type Ca2+ current in response to voltage-clamp stimuli, inactivation of LCC current with and without Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, voltage-dependence of excitation-contraction coupling gain, graded release, and the force-frequency relationship. The model does so with low computational cost.},

abstract = {Metal ions play significant roles in biological systems. Accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on these systems require a validated set of parameters. Although there are more detailed ways to model metal ions, the nonbonded model, which employs a 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) term plus an electrostatic potential is still widely used in MD simulations today due to its simple form. However, LJ parameters have limited transferability due to different combining rules, various water models and diverse simulation methods. Recently, simulations employing a Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) treatment for long-range electrostatics have become more and more popular owing to their speed and accuracy. In the present work we have systematically designed LJ parameters for 24 +2 metal (M(II)) cations to reproduce different experimental properties appropriate for the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules and PME simulations. We began by testing the transferability of currently available M(II) ion LJ parameters. The results showed that there are differences between simulations employing Ewald summation with other simulation methods and that it was necessary to design new parameters specific for PME based simulations. Employing the thermodynamic integration (TI) method and performing periodic boundary MD simulations employing PME, allowed for the systematic investigation of the LJ parameter space. Hydration free energies (HFEs), the ion-oxygen distance in the first solvation shell (IOD) and coordination numbers (CNs) were obtained for various combinations of the parameters of the LJ potential for four widely used water models (TIP3P, SPC/E, TIP4P and TIP4PEW). Results showed that the three simulated properties were highly correlated. Meanwhile, M(II) ions with the same parameters in different water models produce remarkably different HFEs but similar structural properties. It is difficult to reproduce various experimental values simultaneously because the nonbonded model underestimates the interaction between the metal ions and water molecules at short range. Moreover, the extent of underestimation increases successively for the TIP3P, SPC/E, TIP4PEW and TIP4P water models. Nonetheless, we fitted a curve to describe the relationship between $\epsilon$ (the well depth) and radius (Rmin/2) from experimental data on noble gases to facilitate the generation of the best possible compromise models. Hence, by targeting different experimental values, we developed three sets of parameters for M(II) cations for three different water models (TIP3P, SPC/E and TIP4PEW). These parameters we feel represent the best possible compromise that can be achieved using the nonbonded model for the ions in combination with simple water models. From a computational uncertainty analysis we estimate that the uncertainty in our computed HFEs is on the order of ±1kcal/mol. Further improvements will require more advanced non-bonded models likely with inclusion of polarization.},

These theorems show how the difference between the free energies of two equilibrium states of a system are related to distributions of work along nonequilibrium pathways. Here we significantly extend these theorems by relating the possibly inaccessible equilibrium average of any phase variable to the distribution of work along nonequilibrium paths. The result is elegant and analogous to the static umbrella sampling used with Monte Carlo simulations. The umbrella weight, which is related to the nonequilibrium work, is easy to obtain and efficient to compute. Furthermore, its average may be obtained from the existing nonequilibrium free energy theorem.},

abstract = {Faster aging is predicted in more active tissues and animals because of greater reactive oxygen species generation. Yet age-related cell loss is greater in less active cell types, such as type II muscle fibers. Mitochondrial uncoupling has been proposed as a mechanism that reduces reactive oxygen species production and could account for this paradox between longevity and activity. We distinguished these hypotheses by using innovative optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopic methods applied to noninvasively measured ATP synthesis and O(2) uptake in vivo in human muscle. Here we show that mitochondrial function is unchanged with age in mildly uncoupled tibialis anterior muscle (75{\%} type I) despite a high respiratory rate in adults. In contrast, substantial uncoupling and loss of cellular [ATP] indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction with age was found in the lower respiring and well coupled first dorsal interosseus (43-50{\%} type II) of the same subjects. These results reject respiration rate as the sole factor impacting the tempo of cellular aging. Instead, they support mild uncoupling as a mechanism protecting mitochondrial function and contributing to the paradoxical longevity of the most active muscle fibers.},

Recent studies in brain slices show that when osmolarity is reduced, lambda increases while alpha decreases. In contrast, with increased osmolarity. alpha increases, but lambda attains a plateau. Using homogenization theory and a variety of lattice models, we found that the plateau behavior of lambda can be explained if the shape of brain cells changes nonuniformly during the shrinking or swelling induced by osmotic challenge. The nonuniform cellular shrinkage creates residual extracellular space that temporarily traps diffusing molecules, thus impeding the macroscopic: diffusion. The paper also discusses the definition of tortuosity and its independence of the measurement frame of reference.},

abstract = {Negative feedback loops are a common cellular motif underlying many important gene regulation pathways, and therefore a clear understanding of their dynamics is important for the study of gene regulation. Here we analyze the linear stability of negative feedback loops with and without explicit time delays. When the degradation rates of each loop component are identical, we derive the analytical solution of the condition of marginal stability. In the most general case, when the degradation rates of each component differ, we derive a novel expansion of the condition of marginal stability in terms of the geometric mean and variance of the degradation rates. We use these results to demonstrate how the mathematical representation of a negative feedback loop can be simplified such that the stability characteristics are maintained. Finally we apply these results to study the stability structure of the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop. By simplifying a model involving nuclear and cytoplasmatic molecular species of mdm2 mRNA and Mdm2 protein to a model involving only nuclear components and a time delay (which summarizes transcriptional, nuclear import and export, and translational time scales), we demonstrate how our methods allow for an elucidation of the dynamic instabilities recently observed experimentally in the p53-Mdm2 system as the transcription of p53 changes from low to middle to high rates},

abstract = {Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum. calcium Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). This cyclic mechanism constitutes the driving force for calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm into the myocite lumen, regulating cardiac contractility. PLN undergoes a conformational transition between a relaxed (R) and tense (T) state, an equilibrium perturbed by the addition of SERCA. Here, we show that the single phosphoryl transfer at Ser16 induces a more pronounced conformational switch to the R state in phosphorylated PLN (pPLN). The binding affinity of PLN to SERCA is not affected (K-d values for the transmembrane domains of pPLN and PLN are similar to 60 mu M), supporting the hypothesis that phosphorylation at Ser16 does not dissociate PLN from SERCA. However, the binding surface and dynamics in domain Ib (residues 22-31) change substantially upon phosphorylation. Since PLN can be singly or doubly phosphorylated at Ser16 and Thr17, we propose that these sites remotely control the conformation of domain Ib. These findings constitute a paradigm for how post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic portion of membrane proteins control intramembrane protein-protein interactions.

abstract = {Enhanced cardiac diastolic Ca leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ryanodine receptor may reduce SR Ca content and contribute to arrhythmogenesis. We tested whether beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonists increased SR Ca leak in intact rabbit ventricular myocytes and whether this depends on protein kinase A or Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity. SR Ca leak was assessed by acute block of the ryanodine receptor by tetracaine and assessment of the consequent shift of Ca from cytosol to SR (measured at various SR Ca loads induced by varying frequency). Cytosolic [Ca] ([Ca](i)) and SR Ca load ([Ca](SRT)) were assessed using fluo-4. beta-AR activation by isoproterenol dramatically increased SR Ca leak. However, this effect was not inhibited by blocking protein kinase A by H-89, despite the expected reversal of the isoproterenol-induced enhancement of Ca transient amplitude and [Ca](i) decline rate. In contrast, inhibitors of CaMKII, KN-93, or autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide II or beta-AR blockade reversed the isoproterenol-induced enhancement of SR Ca leak, and CaMKII inhibition could even reduce leak below control levels. Forskolin, which bypasses the beta-AR in activating adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A, did not increase SR Ca leak, despite robust enhancement of Ca transient amplitude and [Ca](i) decline rate. The results suggest that beta-AR stimulation enhances diastolic SR Ca leak in a manner that is (1) CaMKII dependent, (2) not protein kinase A dependent, and 3) not dependent on bulk [Ca](i).},

@article{Fischer1988,
abstract = {The isolation of a novel complementary DNA (cDNA) clone coding for human calmodulin (CaM) is reported. Although it encodes a protein indistinguishable from the only known higher vertebrate calmodulin, its nucleotide sequence varies extensively from that of two previously reported human CaM cDNAs (Wawrzynczak and Perham, 1984; SenGupta et al., 1987). Only 82 and 81{\%} identity, respectively, is found between the newly isolated and the two known human mRNAs in their coding regions. No striking homology is present in their noncoding regions. Codon usage in the three CaM mRNAs is also surprisingly divergent. A 2.3-kilobase mRNA corresponding to the newly isolated clone is expressed to varying extents in several human tissues, together with an approximately 0.8-kilobase mRNA species presumably arising from alternative polyadenylation of the same primary transcript. The results indicate that the human genome contains at least three divergent CaM genes that are under selective pressure to encode an identical protein while maintaining maximally divergent nucleotide sequences. Partial characterization of a genomic clone specifying the 3' portion of the newly identified CaM mRNA shows that this gene contains introns at identical positions as the previously characterized bona fide vertebrate CaM genes. Evolutionary implications of the presence of a CaM multigene family are discussed.},

@article{Elcock1999,
abstract = {Computer simulations were performed to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in promoting fast association of acetylcholinesterase with its peptidic inhibitor, the neurotoxin fasciculin. The encounter of the two macromolecules was simulated with the technique of Brownian dynamics (BD), using atomically detailed structures, and association rate constants were calculated for the wild-type and a number of mutant proteins. In a first set of simulations, the ordering of the experimental rate constants for the mutant proteins was correctly reproduced, although the absolute values of the rate constants were overestimated by a factor of around 30. Rigorous calculations of the full electrostatic interaction energy between the two proteins indicate that this overestimation of association rates results at least in part from approximations made in the description of interaction energetics in the ED simulations. In particular, the initial ED simulations neglect the unfavourable electrostatic desolvation effects that result from the exclusion of high dielectric solvent that accompanies the approach of the two low dielectric proteins. This electrostatic desolvation component is so large that the overall contribution of electrostatics to the binding energy of the complex is unlikely to be strongly favourable. Nevertheless, electrostatic interactions are still responsible for increased association rates, because even if they are unfavourable in the fully formed complex, they are still favourable at intermediate protein-protein separation distances. It therefore appears possible for electrostatic interactions to promote the kinetics of binding even if they do not make a strongly favourable contribution to the thermodynamics of binding. When an approximate description of these electrostatic desolvation effects is included in a second set of ED simulations, the relative ordering of the mutant proteins is again correctly reproduced, but now association rate constants that are much closer in magnitude to the experimental values are obtained. Inclusion of electrostatic desolvation effects also improves reproduction of the experimental ionic strength dependence of the wild-type association rate. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Theoretical models predict that macromolecular crowding can increase protein folding stability, but depending on details of the models (e.g., how the denatured state is represented), the level of stabilization predicted can be very different. In this study, we represented the native and denatured states atomistically, with conformations sampled from explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature and high temperature, respectively. We then designed an efficient algorithm to calculate the allowed fraction, f, when the protein molecule is placed inside a box of crowders. That a fraction of placements of the protein molecule is disallowed because of volume exclusion by the crowders leads to an increase in chemical potential, given by Deltamu = -k(B)T lnf. The difference in Deltamu between the native and denatured states predicts the effect of crowding on the folding free energy. Even when the crowders occupied 35{\%} of the solution volume, the stabilization reached only 1.5 kcal/mol for cytochrome b562. The modest stabilization predicted is consistent with experimental studies. Interestingly, a mixture of different sized crowders was found to exert a greater effect than the sum of the individual species of crowders. The stabilization of crowding on the binding stability of barnase and barstar, based on atomistic modeling of the proteins, was similarly modest. These findings have profound implications for macromolecular crowding inside cells.},

abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1{\%} of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

Recent studies have revealed previously unrecognized contractile regulatory processes, such as G-protein-coupled inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphatase, regulation of myosin light-chain kinase by other kinases, and the functional effects of smooth muscle myosin isoforms. Abnormalities of these regulatory mechanisms and isoform variations may contribute to diseases of smooth muscle, and the G-protein-coupled inhibition of protein phosphatase is also likely to be important in regulating  non-muscle cell functions mediated by cytoplasmic myosin II.},

With this model we are not only able to correctly predict the free energies and selectivity for cation binding sites in proteins and nucleic acids, but we achieve better coordination geometries and can capture more subtle effects such as the exchange of inner shell waters. Additionally, this model does not employ higher-order electrostatics and thus can be easily used with standard force fields.},

The siting preferences of the single components result in clear segregation effects for these binary systems.

The mutants Gly(233) --{\textgreater} Glu, Gly(233) --{\textgreater} Val, Pro(312) --{\textgreater} Ala, Leu(319) --{\textgreater} Arg, and Lys(684) --{\textgreater} Arg differed conspicuously with respect to the behavior of the dephosphoenzyme, although they were previously shown to display a common block of the transformation of the phosphoenzyme from an ADP-sensitive to an ADP-insensitive form. The maximum rate of the ATP binding/phosphoryl transfer reaction was reduced 3.6-fold in mutant Gly(233) --{\textgreater} Glu and more than 50-fold in mutant Lys(684) --{\textgreater} Arg, relative to wild type. In mutant Leu(319) --{\textgreater} Arg, the rate of the Ca(2+)-binding transition was reduced as much as 10-30-fold depending on the presence of ATP. In mutants Gly(233) --{\textgreater} Glu, Gly(233) --{\textgreater} Val, and Pro(312) --{\textgreater} Ala, the rate of the Ca(2+)-binding transition was increased at least 2-3-fold at acid pH but not significantly at neutral pH, suggesting a destabilization of the protonated form. The rate of Ca(2+) dissociation was reduced 12-fold in mutant Pro(312) --{\textgreater} Ala and 3.5-fold in Leu(319) --{\textgreater} Arg, and increased at least 4-fold in a mutant in which the putative Ca(2+) liganding residue Glu(309) was replaced by aspartate. The data support a model in which Pro(312) and Leu(319) are closely associated with the cation binding pocket, Gly(233) is part of a long-range signal transmission pathway between the ion-binding sites and the catalytic site, and Lys(684) is an essential catalytic residue that may function in the same way as its counterpart in the soluble hydrolases belonging to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily.},

abstract = {To bind at an enzyme's active site, a ligand must diffuse or be transported to the enzyme's surface, and, if the binding site is buried, the ligand must diffuse through the protein to reach it. Although the driving force for ligand binding is often ascribed to the hydrophobic effect, electrostatic interactions also influence the binding process of both charged and nonpolar ligands. First, electrostatic steering of charged substrates into enzyme active sites is discussed. This is of particular relevance for diffusion-influenced enzymes. By comparing the results of Brownian dynamics simulations and electrostatic potential similarity analysis for triose-phosphate isomerases, superoxide dismutases, and beta-lactamases from different species, we identify the conserved features responsible for the electrostatic substrate-steering fields. The conserved potentials are localized at the active sites and are the primary determinants of the bimolecular association rates. Then we focus on a more subtle effect, which we will refer to as "ionic tethering." We explore, by means of molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations and electrostatic continuum calculations, how salt links can act as tethers between structural elements of an enzyme that undergo conformational change upon substrate binding, and thereby regulate or modulate substrate binding. This is illustrated for the lipase and cytochrome P450 enzymes. Ionic tethering can provide a control mechanism for substrate binding that is sensitive to the electrostatic properties of the enzyme's surroundings even when the substrate is nonpolar.},

abstract = {T-tubular invaginations of the sarcolemma of ventricular cardiomyocytes contain junctional structures functionally coupling L-type calcium channels to the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-release channels (the ryanodine receptors), and therefore their configuration controls the gain of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). Studies primarily in rodent myocardium have shown the importance of T-tubular structures for calcium transient kinetics and have linked T-tubule disruption to delayed CICR. However, there is disagreement as to the nature of T-tubule changes in human heart failure. We studied isolated ventricular myocytes from patients with ischemic heart disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and determined T-tubule structure with either the fluorescent membrane dye di-8-ANNEPs or the scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM). The SICM uses a scanning pipette to produce a topographic representation of the surface of the live cell by a non-optical method. We have also compared ventricular myocytes from a rat model of chronic heart failure after myocardial infarction. T-tubule loss, shown by both ANNEPs staining and SICM imaging, was pronounced in human myocytes from all etiologies of disease. SICM imaging showed additional changes in surface structure, with flattening and loss of Z-groove definition common to all etiologies. Rat myocytes from the chronic heart failure model also showed both T-tubule and Z-groove loss, as well as increased spark frequency and greater spark amplitude. This study confirms the loss of T-tubules as part of the phenotypic change in the failing human myocyte, but it also shows that this is part of a wider spectrum of alterations in surface morphology.},

abstract = {Using cryo-electron microscopy, single particle image processing and three-dimensional reconstruction with icosahedral averaging, we have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of bacteriophage MS2 capsids reassembled from recombinant protein in the presence of short oligonucleotides. We have also significantly extended the resolution of the previously reported structure of the wild-type MS2 virion. The structures of recombinant MS2 capsids reveal clear density for bound RNA beneath the coat protein binding sites on the inner surface of the T = 3 MS2 capsid, and show that a short extension of the minimal assembly initiation sequence that promotes an increase in the efficiency of assembly, interacts with the protein capsid forming a network of bound RNA. The structure of the wild-type MS2 virion at similar to 9 angstrom resolution reveals icosahedrally ordered density encompassing similar to 90{\%} of the single-stranded RNA genome. The genome in the wild-type virion is arranged as two concentric shells of density, connected along the 5-fold symmetry axes of the particle. This novel RNA fold provides new constraints for models of viral assembly. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Of all the myosin filaments in muscle, the most important in terms of human health, and so far the least studied, are those in the human heart. Here we report a 3D single-particle analysis of electron micrograph images of negatively stained myosin filaments isolated from human cardiac muscle in the normal (undiseased) relaxed state. The resulting 28-{\AA} resolution 3D reconstruction shows axial and azimuthal (no radial) myosin head perturbations within the 429-{\AA} axial repeat, with rotations between successive 132 {\AA}-, 148 {\AA}-, and 149 {\AA}-spaced crowns of heads close to 60°, 35°, and 25° (all would be 40° in an unperturbed three-stranded helix). We have defined the myosin head atomic arrangements within the three crown levels and have modeled the organization of myosin subfragment 2 and the possible locations of the 39 {\AA}-spaced domains of titin and the cardiac isoform of myosin-binding protein-C on the surface of the myosin filament backbone. Best fits were obtained with head conformations on all crowns close to the structure of the two-headed myosin molecule of vertebrate chicken smooth muscle in the dephosphorylated relaxed state. Individual crowns show differences in head-pair tilts and subfragment 2 orientations, which, together with the observed perturbations, result in different intercrown head interactions, including one not reported before. Analysis of the interactions between the myosin heads, the cardiac isoform of myosin-binding protein-C, and titin will aid in understanding of the structural effects of mutations in these proteins known to be associated with human cardiomyopathies.},

abstract = {We have performed microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the structural dynamics of cation-bound E1 intermediate states of the calcium pump (sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase, SERCA) in atomic detail, including a lipid bilayer with aqueous solution on both sides. X-ray crystallography with 40 mM Mg²⁺ in the absence of Ca²⁺ has shown that SERCA adopts an E1 structure with transmembrane Ca²⁺-binding sites I and II exposed to the cytosol, stabilized by a single Mg²⁺ bound to a hybrid binding site I'. This Mg²⁺-bound E1 intermediate state, designated E1•Mg²⁺, is proposed to constitute a functional SERCA intermediate that catalyzes the transition from E2 to E1•2Ca²⁺ by facilitating H⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange. To test this hypothesis, we performed two independent MD simulations based on the E1•Mg²⁺ crystal structure, starting in the presence or absence of initially-bound Mg²⁺. Both simulations were performed for 1 µs in a solution containing 100 mM K⁺ and 5 mM Mg²⁺ in the absence of Ca²⁺, mimicking muscle cytosol during relaxation. In the presence of initially-bound Mg²⁺, SERCA site I' maintained Mg²⁺ binding during the entire MD trajectory, and the cytosolic headpiece maintained a semi-open structure. In the absence of initially-bound Mg²⁺, two K⁺ ions rapidly bound to sites I and I' and stayed loosely bound during most of the simulation, while the cytosolic headpiece shifted gradually to a more open structure. Thus MD simulations predict that both E1•Mg²⁺ and E•2K+ intermediate states of SERCA are populated in solution in the absence of Ca²⁺, with the more open 2K+-bound state being more abundant at physiological ion concentrations. We propose that the E1•2K⁺ state acts as a functional intermediate that facilitates the E2 to E1•2Ca²⁺ transition through two mechanisms: by pre-organizing transport sites for Ca²⁺ binding, and by partially opening the cytosolic headpiece prior to Ca²⁺ activation of nucleotide binding.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of the normal heartbeat are both rapid onset of contraction and rapid relaxation as well as an inotropic response to both increased end-diastolic volume and increased heart rate. At the microscopic level, Ca(2+) plays a crucial role in normal cardiac contraction. This paper reviews the cycle of Ca(2+) fluxes during the normal heartbeat, which underlie the coupling between excitation and contraction and permit a highly synchronized action of cardiac sarcomeres. Length dependence of the response of the regulatory sarcomeric proteins mediates the Frank-Starling Law of the heart. However, Ca(2+) transport may go astray in heart disease such as in congestive heart failure, and both jeopardize systole and diastole and triggering arrhythmias. The interaction between weak and strong segments in nonuniform cardiac muscle allows partial preservation of force of contraction but may further lead to mechanoelectric feedback or reverse excitation-contraction coupling mediating an early diastolic Ca(2+) transient caused by the rapid force decrease during the relaxation phase. These rapid force changes in nonuniform muscle may cause arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves to propagate by the activation of neighboring sarcoplasmic reticulum by diffusing Ca(2+) ions.},

abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated higher systolic [Ca(2+)](i) amplitudes result in faster [Ca(2+)](i) decline rates, as does $\beta$-adrenergic ($\beta$-AR) stimulation. The purpose of this study is to determine the major factor responsible for the faster [Ca(2+)](i) decline rate with $\beta$-AR stimulation, the increased systolic [Ca(2+)] levels or phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB). Mouse myocytes were perfused under basal conditions (1mM [Ca(2+)](o)), followed by high extracellular calcium (3mM [Ca(2+)](o)), washout with 1mM [Ca(2+)](o), followed by 1$\mu$M isoproterenol (ISO) with 1mM [Ca(2+)](o). ISO increased Serine16 phosphorylation compared to 3 mM [Ca(2+)](o) while Threonine17 phosphorylation was similar. Ca(2+) transient (CaT) (Fluo-4) data were obtained from matched CaT amplitudes with 3mM [Ca(2+)](o) and ISO. [Ca2+]i decline was significantly faster with ISO compared to 3mM [Ca(2+)](o). Interestingly, the faster decline with ISO was only seen during the first 50{\%} of the decline. CaT time to peak was significantly faster with ISO compared to 3mM [Ca(2+)](o). A CAMKII inhibitor (KN-93) did not affect the CaT decline rates with 3mM [Ca(2+)](o) or ISO, but normalized ISO's time to peak with 3mM [Ca(2+)](o). Thus, during $\beta$-AR stimulation the major factor for the faster CaT decline is due to Serine16 phosphorylation and faster time to peak is due to CAMKII activation.},

abstract = {Intracellular detection of virus infections is a critical component of innate immunity carried out by molecules known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Activation of PRRs by their respective pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) leads to production of proinflamatory cytokines, including type I IFN, and the establishment of an antiviral state in the host. Out of all PRRs found to date, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) has been shown to play a key role in recognition of RNA viruses. On the basis of in vitro and transfection studies, 5'ppp RNA produced during virus replication is thought to bind and activate this important sensor. However, the nature of RNA molecules that interact with endogenous RIG-I during the course of viral infection has not been determined. In this work we use next-generation RNA sequencing to show that RIG-I preferentially associates with shorter, 5'ppp containing viral RNA molecules in infected cells. We found that during Sendai infection RIG-I specifically bound the genome of the defective interfering (DI) particle and did not bind the full-length virus genome or any other viral RNAs. In influenza-infected cells RIG-I preferentially associated with shorter genomic segments as well as subgenomic DI particles. Our analysis for the first time identifies RIG-I PAMPs under natural infection conditions and implies that full-length genomes of single segmented RNA virus families are not bound by RIG-I during infection.},

Cardiac TnC contains two Ca2+ binding sites, with one site being naturally defunct. Previously, binding of Ca2+ to the functional site in the regulatory domain of TnC was shown to lead to a decrease in conformational entropy (T$\Delta$S) of 2 and 0.5 kcal mol-1 for the functional and nonfunctional sites, respectively, using 15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation studies [Spyracopoulos, L., et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 18032−18044]. In this study, backbone dynamics of the Ca2+-free regulatory domain are investigated by backbone amide 15N relaxation measurements at eight temperatures from 5 to 45 °C. Analysis of the relaxation measurements yields an order parameter (S2) indicating the degree of spatial restriction for a backbone amide H−N vector. The temperature dependence of S2 allows estimation of the co...},

To determine which dynamic range dominates a response, we used periodic stimuli to measure the frequency dependence of signal transduction in the osmo-adaptation pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied system identification methods to infer a concise predictive model. We found that the dynamics of the osmo-adaptation response are dominated by a fast-acting negative feedback through the kinase Hog1 that does not require protein synthesis. After large osmotic shocks, an additional, much slower, negative feedback through gene expression allows cells to respond faster to future stimuli.},

abstract = {Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is the Ca2+-dependent switch for contraction in heart muscle and a potential target for drugs in the therapy of heart failure. Ca2+ binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC (cNTnC) induces little structural change but sets the stage for cTnI binding. A large "closed" to "open" conformational transition occurs in the regulatory domain upon binding cTnI(147-163) or bepridil. This raises the question of whether cTnI(147-163) and bepridil compete for cNTnC.Ca2+. In this work, we used two-dimensional H-1,N-15-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NAIR spectroscopy to examine the binding of bepridil to cNTnC.Ca2+ in the absence and presence of cTnI(147-163) and of cTnI(147-163) to cNTnC.Ca2+ in the absence and presence of bepridil. The results show that bepridil and cTnI147-163 bind cNTnC.Ca2+ simultaneously but with negative cooperativity. The affinity of cTnI(147-163) for cNTnC.Ca2+ is reduced similar to 3.5-fold by bepridil and vice versa. Using multinuclear and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the structure of the cNTnC.Ca2+ cTnI(147-163).bepridil ternary complex. The structure reveals a binding site for cTnI(147-163) primarily located on the A/B interhelical interface and a binding site for bepridil in the hydrophobic pocket of cNTnC.Ca2+. In the structure, the N terminus of the peptide clashes with part of the bepridil molecule, which explains the negative cooperativity between cTnI(147-163) and bepridil for cNTnC.Ca2+. This structure provides insights into the features that are important for the design of cTnC-specific cardiotonic drugs, which may be used to modulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments in heart muscle contraction.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the diabetic population. However, molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic cardiomyopathy remain unclear. We analyzed Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and excitation-contraction coupling in db/db obese type 2 diabetic mice and their control littermates. Echocardiography showed a systolic dysfunction in db/db mice. Two-photon microscopy identified intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) transient decrease in cardiomyocytes within the whole heart, which was also found in isolated myocytes by confocal microscopy. Global [Ca2+](i) transients are constituted of individual sparks. Ca2+ sparks in db/db cardiomyocytes were less frequent than in +/+ myocytes, partly because of a depression in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load but also because of a reduced expression of ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channels (RyRs), revealed by [H-3]ryanodine binding assay. Ca2+ efflux through Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was increased in db/db myocytes. Calcium current, I-Ca, triggers sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and is also involved in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ refilling. Macroscopic I-Ca was reduced in db/db cells, but single Ca2+ channel activity was similar, suggesting that diabetic myocytes express fewer functional Ca2+ channels, which was confirmed by Western blots. These results demonstrate that db/db mice show depressed cardiac function, at least in part, because of a general reduction in the membrane permeability to Ca. As less Ca2+ enters the cell through I-Ca, less Ca2+ is released through RyRs.},

We have developed a model that describes quantitatively the published experimental data on dependence of the rate of oxygen consumption and metabolic state of working isolated perfused rat heart on workload over its physiological range (Williamson JR, Ford G, Illingworth J, Safer B. Circ Res 38, Suppl I, I39-I51, 1976). Analysis of this model shows that for phosphocreatine, creatine, and ATP the equilibrium assumption is an acceptable approximation with respect to their diffusion in the intracellular bulk water phase. However, the ADP concentration changes in the contraction cycle in a nonequilibrium workload-dependent manner, showing the existence of the intracellular concentration gradients. The model shows that workload-dependent alteration of ADP concentration in the compartmentalized creatine kinase system may be taken, together with the changes in P(i) concentration, to be among the major components of the metabolic feedback signal for regulation of respiration in muscle cells.},

@article{Markowitz2005,
abstract = {S100B is a dimeric Ca(2+)-binding protein that undergoes a 90 +/- 3 degrees rotation of helix 3 in the typical EF-hand domain (EF2) upon the addition of calcium. The large reorientation of this helix is a prerequisite for the interaction between each subunit of S100B and target proteins such as the tumor suppressor protein, p53. In this study, Tb(3+) was used as a probe to examine how binding of a 22-residue peptide derived from the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 affects the rate of Ca(2+) ion dissociation. In competition studies with Tb(3+), the dissociation rates of Ca(2+) (k(off)) from the EF2 domains of S100B in the absence and presence of the p53 peptide was determined to be 60 and 7 s(-)(1), respectively. These data are consistent with a previously reported result, which showed that that target peptide binding to S100B enhances its calcium-binding affinity [Rustandi et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 1951-1960]. The corresponding Ca(2+) association rate constants for S100B, k(on), for the EF2 domains in the absence and presence of the p53 peptide are 1.1 x 10(6) and 3.5 x 10(5) M(-)(1) s(-)(1), respectively. These two association rate constants are significantly below the diffusion control ( approximately 10(9) M(-)(1) s(-)(1)) and likely involve both Ca(2+) ion association and a Ca(2+)-dependent structural rearrangement, which is slightly different when the target peptide is present. EF-hand calcium-binding mutants of S100B were engineered at the -Z position (EF-hand 1, E31A; EF-hand 2, E72A; both EF-hands, E31A + E72A) and examined to further understand how specific residues contribute to calcium binding in S100B in the absence and presence of the p53 peptide.},

Calcineurin activity is mainly triggered by calcium/calmodulin binding but also through calpain mediated cleavage. How controlled calcineurin activation is possible in cardiac myocytes, which typically show a 10-fold difference in cytosolic calcium concentration with every heartbeat, has remained enigmatic. It is now emerging that calcineurin activation and signaling occur in subcellular microdomains, in which it is brought together with target proteins and exceedingly high concentrations of calcium in order to induce downstream signaling. We review current evidence of subcellular calcineurin mainly at the sarcolemma and the nucleus, but also in association with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. We also suggest that knowledge about subcellular signaling could help to develop inhibitors of calcineurin in specific microdomains to avoid side-effects that may arise from complete calcineurin inhibition.},

abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model of the human atria myocyte based on averaged voltage-clamp data recorded from isolated single myocytes. Our model consists of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type equivalent circuit for the sarcolemma, coupled with a fluid compartment model, which accounts for changes in ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm as well as in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This formulation can reconstruct action potential data that are representative of recordings from a majority of human atrial cells in our laboratory and therefore provides a biophysically based account of the underlying ionic currents. This work is based in part on a previous model of the rabbit atrial myocyte published by our group and was motivated by differences in some of the repolarizing currents between human and rabbit atrium. We have therefore given particular attention to the sustained outward K+ current (I[sus]), which putatively has a prominent role in determining the duration of the human atrial action potential. Our results demonstrate that the action potential shape during the peak and plateau phases is determined primarily by transient outward K+ current, I(sus) and L-type Ca2+ current (I[Ca,L]) and that the role of I(sus) in the human atrial action potential can be modulated by the baseline sizes of I(Ca,L), I(sus) and the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current. As a result, our simulations suggest that the functional role of I(sus) can depend on the physiological/disease state of the cell.},

This paper reviews physics-based models of binding, beginning with a summary of the changes in potential energy, solvation energy, and configurational entropy that influence affinity, and a theoretical overview to frame the discussion of specific computational approaches. Important advances are reported in modeling protein-ligand energetics, such as the incorporation of electronic polarization and the use of quantum mechanical methods. Recent calculations suggest that changes in configurational entropy strongly oppose binding and must be included if accurate affinities are to be obtained. The linear interaction energy (LIE) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmarm surface area (A/IM-PBSA) methods are analyzed, as are free energy pathway methods, which show promise and may be ready for more extensive testing. Ultimately, major improvements in modeling accuracy will likely require advances on multiple fronts, as well as continued validation against experiment.},

abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels are required for maintenance of homeostasis during the metabolically demanding adaptive response to stress. However, in disease, the effect of cellular remodeling on K(ATP) channel behavior and associated tolerance to metabolic insult is unknown. Here, transgenic expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha induced heart failure with typical cardiac structural and energetic alterations. In this paradigm of disease remodeling, K(ATP) channels responded aberrantly to metabolic signals despite intact intrinsic channel properties, implicating defects proximal to the channel. Indeed, cardiomyocytes from failing hearts exhibited mitochondrial and creatine kinase deficits, and thus a reduced potential for metabolic signal generation and transmission. Consequently, K(ATP) channels failed to properly translate cellular distress under metabolic challenge into a protective membrane response. Failing hearts were excessively vulnerable to metabolic insult, demonstrating cardiomyocyte calcium loading and myofibrillar contraction banding, with tolerance improved by K(ATP) channel openers. Thus, disease-induced K(ATP) channel metabolic dysregulation is a contributor to the pathobiology of heart failure, illustrating a mechanism for acquired channelopathy.},

abstract = {In the heart, intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)]i) is a key modulator of Ca(2+) cycling, contractility and cardiac myocyte metabolism. Several Na(+) transporters are electrogenic, thus they both contribute to shaping the cardiac action potential and at the same time are affected by it. [Na(+)]i is controlled by the balance between Na(+) influx through various pathways, including the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and Na(+) channels, and Na(+) extrusion via the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. [Na(+)]i is elevated in HF due to a combination of increased entry through Na(+) channels and/or Na(+)/H(+) exchanger and reduced activity of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Here we review the major Na(+) transport pathways in cardiac myocytes and how they participate in regulating [Na(+)]i in normal and failing hearts.

abstract = {To begin to elucidate the principles of intermolecular dynamics in the crowded environment of cells, employing brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, we examined possible mechanism(s) responsible for the great reduction in diffusion constants of macromolecules in vivo from that at infinite dilution. In an Escherichia coli cytoplasm model comprised of 15 different macromolecule types at physiological concentrations, BD simulations of molecular-shaped and equivalent sphere representations were performed with a soft repulsive potential. At cellular concentrations, the calculated diffusion constant of GFP is much larger than experiment, with no significant shape dependence. Next, using the equivalent sphere system, hydrodynamic interactions (HI) were considered. Without adjustable parameters, the in vivo experimental GFP diffusion constant was reproduced. Finally, the effects of nonspecific attractive interactions were examined. The reduction in diffusivity is very sensitive to macromolecular radius with the motion of the largest macromolecules dramatically slowed down; this is not seen if HI dominate. In addition, long-lived clusters involving the largest macromolecules form if attractions dominate, whereas HI give rise to significant, size independent intermolecular dynamic correlations. These qualitative differences provide a testable means of differentiating the importance of HI vs. nonspecific attractive interactions on macromolecular motion in cells.},

This special type of product activation has been shown to lead to self-sustained pH oscillations in an enzyme-loaded membrane. We investigate the possibility of oscillations in a model of the urea-urease reaction, prompted by the recent experimental discovery of feedback in this reaction. An open system is considered in which acid and urea are transported to a cell containing the enzyme. Using linear stability analysis we determine the range of transport coefficients limit cycles may exist for and show that differential transport is required for oscillations in a class of compartmentalized enzyme processes similar to the urea-urease system. We demonstrate that although the transport rate of acid (k(H)) must be greater than that of urea (k(S)) for oscillations in a urease-loaded membrane, bistability is possible for k(S) ≥ k(H).},

abstract = {Our aim was to measure the influence of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium content ([Ca](SRT)) and free SR [Ca] ([Ca](SR)) on the fraction of SR calcium released during voltage clamp steps in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. [Ca](SRT), as measured by caffeine application, was progressively increased by conditioning pulses. Sodium was absent in both the intracellular and in the extracellular solutions to block sodium/calcium exchange. Total cytosolic calcium flux during the transient was inferred from I(Ca), [Ca](SRT), [Ca](i), and cellular buffering characteristics. Fluxes via the calcium current (I(Ca)), the SR calcium pump, and passive leak from the SR were evaluated to determine SR calcium release flux (J(rel)). Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling was characterized with respect to both gain (integral J(rel)/integral I(Ca)) and fractional SR calcium release. Both parameters were virtually zero for a small, but measurable [Ca](SRT). Gain and fractional SR calcium release increased steeply and nonlinearly with both [Ca](SRT) and [Ca](SR). We conclude that potentiation of EC coupling can be correlated with both [Ca](SRT) and [Ca](SR). While fractional SR calcium release was not linearly dependent upon [Ca](SR), intra-SR calcium may play a crucial role in regulating the SR calcium release process.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is the primary mediator of Ca signal transduction processes in cells. Unlike animal cells, plant cells express multiple CaM isoforms. One cloned soybean CaM isoform (SCaM-4) half-maximally activated mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS) at 180 nM while another (SCaM-1) served as a competitive antagonist (Ki ≈ 120 nM) of this activation. The reciprocal was true for the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN); SCaM-1 half-maximally activated mammalian CaN at ∼12 nM, and SCaM-4 competitively antagonized (Ki ≈ 70 nM) its activation. The reciprocal enzyme activation and competitive inhibition exhibited by these plant CaM isoforms suggest that their differential expression in cells could allow selective activation of some target enzymes and the selective inhibition of others. This may allow for a branching or bifurcation in the Ca2+-CaM signal transduction pathway and to alterations in cell function.},

The acquisition of the diffusion-sensitized spectra was optimized in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio for ATP by using a frequency-selective stimulated echo sequence in combination with adiabatic radio-frequency pulses and surface coil signal excitation and reception. Diffusion restriction was studied by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficients of ATP and PCr as a function of the diffusion time. Orientation effects were eliminated by determining the trace of the diffusion tensor. The data were fitted to a cylindrical restriction model to estimate the unbounded diffusion coefficient and the radial dimensions of the restricting compartment. The unbounded diffusion coefficients of ATP and PCr were {\~{}}90{\%} of their in vitro values at 37{\^{}}oC. The diameters of the cylindrical restriction compartment were {\~{}}16 and {\~{}}22@mm for ATP and PCr, respectively. The diameters of rat skeletal muscle fibers are known to range from 60 to 80@mm. The modelling therefore suggests that the in vivo restriction of ATP and PCr diffusion is not imposed by the sarcolemma but by other, intracellular structures with an overall cylindrical orientation.},

abstract = {Our goal is to provide a perspective on current understanding of the origins of specificity in immune reactions, a topic that has intrigued scientists for over a century. A fundamental property of adaptive immune responses is the ability to discriminate among an immense variety of substances by means of antibodies (Abs) and Ab-like receptors on T lymphocytes [T-cell receptors (TCRs)], each able to bind a particular chemical structure [the antigen (Ag)] and not, or only weakly, similar alternatives. Evidence has long existed, however, and has grown, especially recently, that while exhibiting remarkable specificity, many individual Abs and TCRs can also bind a variety of very different ligands. How can Ag recognition by these receptors exercise the great specificity for which they are renowned and yet react with a variety of different ligands (degeneracy)? We critically consider the mechanistic bases for this specificity/degeneracy enigma and also compare and contrast Ag recognition by Abs and TCRs.},

@article{Sachse2012,
abstract = {Rationale: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with chronic heart failure. However, CRT-associated structural and functional remodeling at cellular and subcellular levels is only partly understood. Objective: To investigate the effects of CRT on subcellular structures and protein distributions associated with excitation-contraction coupling of ventricular cardiomyocytes.Methods and Results: Our studies revealed remodeling of the transverse tubular system (t-system) and the spatial association of ryanodine receptor (RyR) clusters in a canine model of dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF). We did not find this remodeling in a synchronous heart failure model based on atrial tachypacing. Remodeling in DHF ranged from minor alterations in anterior left ventricular myocytes to nearly complete loss of the t-system and dissociation of RyRs from sarcolemmal structures in lateral cells. After CRT, we found a remarkable and almost complete reverse remodeling of these structures despite persistent left ventricular dysfunction. Studies of whole-cell Ca2+ transients showed that the structural remodeling and restoration were accompanied with remodeling and restoration of Ca2+ signaling.Conclusions: DHF is associated with regional remodeling of the t-system. Myocytes undergo substantial structural and functional restoration after only 3 weeks of CRT. The finding suggests that t-system status can provide an early marker of the success of this therapy. The results could also guide us to an understanding of the loss and remodeling of proteins associated with the t-system. The steep relationship between free Ca2+ and contraction suggests that some restoration of Ca2+ release units will have a disproportionately large effect on contractility.

abstract = {To examine the wide variety of cavities available to water molecules inside proteins, a model of the protein cavities is developed with the local environment treated at atomic detail and the nonlocal environment treated approximately. The cavities are then changed to vary in size and in the number of hydrogen bonds available to a water molecule inside the cavity. The free energy, entropy, and enthalpy change for the transfer of a water molecule to the cavity from the bulk liquid is calculated from thermodynamic integration. The results of the model are close to those of similar cavities calculated using the full protein and solvent environment. As the number of hydrogen bonds resulting from the addition of the water molecule increases, the free energy decreases, as the enthalpic gain of making a hydrogen bond outweighs the entropic cost. Changing the volume of the cavity has a smaller effect on the thermodynamics. Once the hydrogen bond contribution is taken into account, the volume dependence on DeltaG, DeltaS, and DeltaH is small and roughly the same for a hydrophobic cavity as a hydrophilic cavity.},

We present a detailed analysis of the process of voltage driven capture of DNA molecules by nanopores. We show that ionic current generates a nonuniform electric field that acts on both the DNA and on its counterions and that the response of DNA to the electric field is affected by its electroosmotic coupling to the mobile counterions. We calculate the voltage and molecular mass dependence of the radius of capture and of the capture rate in the diffusion limited regime. We argue that electroosmotic flow through the DNA coil is suppressed in the vicinity of the pore and present a tentative estimate of the capture rate in the barrier limited regime.},

abstract = {Protein dynamics on the atomic level and on the microsecond timescale has recently become accessible from both computation and experiment. To validate molecular dynamics (MD) at the submicrosecond timescale against experiment we present microsecond MD simulations in 10 different force-field configurations for two globular proteins, ubiquitin and the gb3 domain of protein G, for which extensive NMR data is available. We find that the reproduction of the measured NMR data strongly depends on the chosen force field and electrostatics treatment. Generally, particle-mesh Ewald outperforms cut-off and reaction-field approaches. A comparison to measured J-couplings across hydrogen bonds suggests that there is room for improvement in the force-field description of hydrogen bonds in most modern force fields. Our results show that with current force fields, simulations beyond hundreds of nanoseconds run an increased risk of undergoing transitions to nonnative conformational states or will persist within states of high free energy for too long, thus skewing the obtained population frequencies. Only for the AMBER99sb force field have such transitions not been observed. Thus, our results have significance for the interpretation of data obtained with long MD simulations, for the selection of force fields for MD studies and for force-field development. We hope that this comprehensive benchmark based on NMR data applied to many popular MD force fields will serve as a useful resource to the MD community. Finally, we find that for gb3, the force-field AMBER99sb reaches comparable accuracy in back-calculated residual dipolar couplings and J-couplings across hydrogen bonds to ensembles obtained by refinement against NMR data.},

abstract = {The concept of isogeometric analysis is proposed. Basis functions generated from NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are employed to construct an exact geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection–diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages.},

We found that the allosteric regulation of SERCA depends on the conformational equilibrium of PLN, whose cytoplasmic regulatory domain interconverts between three different states: a ground T state (helical and membrane associated), an excited R state (unfolded and membrane detached), and a B state (extended and enzyme-bound), which is noninhibitory. Phosphorylation at Ser-16 of PLN shifts the populations toward the B state, increasing SERCA activity. We conclude that PLN's conformational equilibrium is central to maintain SERCA's apparent Ca(2+) affinity within a physiological window. This model represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of SERCA regulation by posttranslational phosphorylation and suggests strategies for designing innovative therapeutic approaches to enhance cardiac muscle contractility.},

The macroscopic equivalent diffusion tensor and the macroscopic governing equations for the average concentration field can be deduced by homogenization. The necessary condition for this theory to be applied is the existence of a small parameter epsilon defined as the ratio of the scale of the pores and the scale of a sample, which can be distinguished in the heterogeneous medium. Transport processes with respect to different dominating phenomena, related to epsilon, have been examined. Using the analysis performed the condition has been specified when the homogenization is not possible, i.e. when it is impossible to find the rigorous macroscopic equivalent description.},

abstract = {The integral membrane protein complex between phospholamban (PLN) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) regulates cardiac contractility. In the unphosphorylated form, PLN binds SERCA and inhibits Ca2+ flux. Upon phosphorylation of PLN at Ser16, the inhibitory effect is reversed. Although structural details on both proteins are emerging from X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and NMR studies, the molecular mechanisms of their interactions and regulatory process are still lacking. It has been speculated that SERCA regulation depends on PLN structural transitions (order to disorder, i.e., folding/unfolding). Here, we investigated PLN conformational changes upon chemical unfolding by a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance and NMR spectroscopies, revealing that the conformational transitions involve mostly the cytoplasmic regions, with two concomitant phenomena: (1) membrane binding and folding of the amphipathic domain Ia and (2) folding/unfolding of the juxtamembrane domain lb of PLN. Analysis of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PLN with two phosphomimetic mutants of PLN (516E and S16D) shows that the population of an unfolded state in domains Ia and lb (T' state) is linearly correlated to the extent of SERCA inhibition measured by activity assays. Inhibition of SERCA is carried out by the folded ground state (T state) of the protein (PLN), while the relief of inhibition involves promotion of PLN to excited conformational states (Ser16 phosphorylated PLN). We propose that PLN population shifts (folding/unfolding) are a key regulatory mechanism for SERCA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding the detailed mechanism of the activation of voltage-gated ion channels has been a problem of great current interest. Reliable molecular simulations of voltage effects present a major challenge because meaningful converging microscopic simulations are not yet available and macroscopic treatments involve major uncertainties regarding the dielectric constant used and other key features. The current work has overcome some of the above challenges by using our recently developed coarse-grained (CG) model in simulating the activation of the Kv1.2 channel. The CG model has allowed us to explore problems that cannot be addressed at present by fully microscopic simulations, while providing insights on some features that are not usually considered in continuum models, including the distribution of the electrolytes between the membrane and the electrodes during the activation process and thus the nature of the gating current. Furthermore, the clear connection to microscopic descriptions combined with the power of CG modeling offers a powerful tool for exploring the energy balance between the protein conformational energy and the interaction with the external potential in voltage-activated channels. Our simulations have reproduced the observed experimental trend of the gating charge and, most significantly, the correct trend in the free energies, where the closed channel is more stable at negative potential and the open channel is more stable at positive potential. Moreover, we provide a unique view of the activation landscape and the time dependence of the activation process.},

abstract = {Adrenergic stimulation modulates cardiac function by altering the phosphorylation status of several cardiac proteins. The Troponin complex, which is the Ca(2+) sensor for cardiac contraction, is a hot spot for adrenergic phosphorylation. While the effect of $\beta$-adrenergic related PKA phosphorylation of troponin I at Ser23/24 is well established, the effects of $\alpha$-adrenergic induced PKC phosphorylation on multiple sites of TnI (Ser43/45, Thr144) and TnT (Thr194, Ser198, Thr203 and Thr284) are much less clear. By utilizing an IAANS labeled fluorescent troponin C, TnC(IAANS)(T53C), we systematically examined the site specific effects of PKC phosphomimetic mutants of TnI and TnT on TnC's Ca(2+) binding properties in the Tn complex and reconstituted thin filament. The majority of the phosphomemetics had little effect on the Ca(2+) binding properties of the isolated Tn complex. However, when incorporated into the thin filament, the phosphomimetics typically altered thin filament Ca(2+) sensitivity in a way consistent with their respective effects on Ca(2+) sensitivity of skinned muscle preparations. The altered Ca(2+) sensitivity could be generally explained by a change in Ca(2+) dissociation rates. Within TnI, phosphomimetic Asp and Glu did not always behave similar, nor were Ala mutations (used to mimic non-phosphorylatable states) benign to Ca(2+) binding. Our results suggest that Troponin may act as a hub on the thin filament, sensing physiological stimuli to modulate the contractile performance of the heart.},

This study compares the equilibrium Ca2+ binding and Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of CaM complexed to target peptides derived from five different CaM-regulated proteins: phosphorylase kinase. CaM-dependent protein kinase II, skeletal and smooth myosin light chain kinases, and the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase. The results reveal that different target peptides can tune the Ca2+ binding affinities and kinetics of the two CaM domains over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations and time scales. The five peptides increase the Ca2+ affinity of the N-terminal regulatory domain from 14- to 350-fold and slow its Ca2+ dissociation kinetics from 60- to 140-fold. Smaller effects are observed for the C-terminal domain, where peptides increase the apparent Ca2+ affinity 8- to 100-fold and slow dissociation kinetics 13- to 132-fold. In full-length skeletal myosin light chain kinase the inter-molecular tuning provided by the isolated target peptide is further modulated by other tuning interactions, resulting in a CaM-protein complex that has a 10-fold lower Ca2+ affinity than the analogous CaM-peptide complex. Unlike the CaM-peptide complexes, Ca2+ dissociation from the protein complex follows monoexponential kinetics in which all four Ca2+ ions dissociate at a rate comparable to the slow rate observed in the peptide complex. The two Ca2+ ions bound to the CaM N-terminal domain are substantially occluded in the CaM-protein complex. Overall, the results indicate that the cellular activation of myosin light chain kinase is likely to be triggered by the binding of free Ca2(2+)-CaM or Ca4(2+)-CaM after a Ca2+ signal has begun and that inactivation of the complex is initiated by a single rate-limiting event, which is proposed to be either the direct dissociation of Ca2+ ions from the bound C-terminal domain or the dissociation of Ca2+ loaded C-terminal domain from skMLCK. The observed target-induced variations in Ca2+ affinities and dissociation rates could serve to tune CaM activation and inactivation for different cellular pathways, and also must counterbalance the variable energetic costs of driving the activating conformational change in different target enzymes.},

Conductivity correlates negatively with both GAG and collagen concentration over a wide variety of tissues. Conductivities of GAG matrices in vitro, coupled with other quantitative considerations, indicate, however, that no single class of fixed fibrous element exists at a sufficiently high concentration to account by itself for the low conductivity in most tissues. It seems that the low interstitial conductivity arises from the combined interactive effects of three main classes of fibrous element: collagen fibrils, GAG and proteoglycan core protein. In most cases the proteoglycan complex plays a major role which is significantly amplified, however, by the collagen fibril network.},

abstract = {Cardiac sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange is a central component of Ca2+ signaling essential for Ca2+ extrusion and contributing to a variable degree to the development of the systolic Ca2+ transient. Reports on differential gene expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchange in cardiac disease and the regulation of its thermodynamic equilibrium depending on intracellular gradients of ion concentrations between subcellular compartments have recently put a new complexion on Na+-Ca2+ exchange and its implications for excitation -contraction (E-C) coupling. Heart failure models and genetic approaches to regulate expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger have improved our knowledge of exchanger function. Modest overexpression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in heterozygous transgenic mice had minimal effects on E-C coupling and cardiac function. However, higher levels of Na+-Ca2+ exchange expression in homozygotes led to pathological hypertrophy and failure with an increased interaction between the L-type Ca2+ current and Na+-Ca2+ exchange and reduced E-C coupling gain. These results suggested that the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is capable of modulating sarcoplasmic Ca2+ handling and at high expression levels may interact with the gating kinetics of the L-type Ca2+ current by means of regulating subsarcolemmal Ca2+ levels. Despite being a central component in the regulation of cardiac E-C coupling, a newly generated mouse model with cardiac-specific conditional knock-out of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is viable with unchanged Ca2+ dynamics in adult ventricular myocytes. Cardiac myocytes adapt well to knock-out of the exchanger, apparently by reducing transsarcolemmal fluxes of Ca2+ and increasing E-C coupling gain possibly mediated by changes in submembrane Ca2+ levels. For E-C coupling in the murine model, which relies primarily on sarcoplasmic Ca2+ regulation, this led to the suggestion that the role of Na+-Ca2+ exchange should be thought of as a Ca2+ buffering function and not as a major Ca2+ transporter in competition with the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

abstract = {Maltose-binding protein (MBP) is a two-domain protein that undergoes a ligand-mediated conformational rearrangement from an "open" to a "closed" structure on binding to maltooligosaccharides. To characterize the energy landscape associated with this transition, we have generated five variants of MBP with mutations located in the hinge region of the molecule. Residual dipolar couplings, measured in the presence of a weak alignment medium, have been used to establish that the average structures of the mutant proteins are related to each other by domain rotation about an invariant axis, with the rotation angle varying from 5 degrees to 28 degrees. Additionally, the domain orientations observed in the wild-type apo and ligand-bound (maltose, maltotriose, etc.) structures are related through a rotation of 35 degrees about the same axis. Remarkably, the free energy of unfolding, measured by equilibrium denaturation experiments and monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, shows a linear correlation with the rotation angle, with the stability of the (apo)protein decreasing with domain closure by 212 +/- 16 cal mol-1 per degree of rotation. The apparent binding energy for maltose also shows a similar correlation with the interdomain angle, suggesting that the mutations, as they relate to binding, affect predominantly the ligand-free structure. The linearity of the energy change is interpreted in terms of an increase in the extent of hydrophobic surface that becomes solvent accessible on closure. The combination of structural, stability, and binding data allows separation of the energetics of domain reorientation from ligand binding. This work presents a near quantitative structure-energy-binding relationship for a series of mutants of MBP, illustrating the power of combined studies involving protein engineering and solution NMR spectroscopy.},

abstract = {A refinement of the oncomodulin crystal structure at 1.30 A resolution has been carried out with X-ray data from the recombinant protein. The crystallographic R-factor values are 0.169 for 19,995 reflections in the range 6.0 to 1.30 A, which were used for the restrained least-squares refinement, and 0.176 for 20,186 observed reflections in the range 10.0 to 1.30 A. This high resolution refinement has enabled us to make more definitive statements about the molecular structure than was possible heretofore. The present model includes residues 1 to 108, the two Ca2+ of the CD and EF loops, two intermolecular Ca2+, and 103 water molecules per oncomodulin molecule. The electron density maps indicate disordered orientations for ten residues on the hydrophilic surface of the molecule. The pattern of molecular aggregation via intermolecular Ca2+, which occurs in the native rat oncomodulin structure, is also present in the recombinant oncomodulin structure. The Cys18 side-chain is not in a position that would be easily accessible for molecular dimerization via a disulphide bond. The substitution of Glu59, which is preserved in all the determined species of parvalbumin, by Asp59 in oncomodulin seems to break a stabilizing hydrogen bond in the CD loop and render the main-chain in positions 59 to 60 somewhat unstable. This instability in the CD loop, and the strong tendency of oncomodulin for molecular aggregation via intermolecular Ca2+, appear to be the two outstanding features that may account for oncomodulin's biological peculiarities.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of a protein can be described as a graph where nodes represent residues and the strength of non-covalent interactions between them are edges. These protein contact networks can be separated into long and short-range interactions networks depending on the positions of amino acids in primary structure. Long-range interactions play a distinct role in determining the tertiary structure of a protein while short-range interactions could largely contribute to the secondary structure formations. In addition, physico chemical properties and the linear arrangement of amino acids of the primary structure of a protein determines its three dimensional structure. Here, we present an extensive analysis of protein contact subnetworks based on the London van der Waals interactions of amino acids at different length scales. We further subdivided those networks in hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues networks and have tried to correlate their influence in the overall topology and organization of a protein.
The largest connected component (LCC) of long (LRN)-, short (SRN)- and all-range (ARN) networks within proteins exhibit a transition behaviour when plotted against different interaction strengths of edges among amino acid nodes. While short-range networks having chain like structures exhibit highly cooperative transition; long- and all-range networks, which are more similar to each other, have non-chain like structures and show less cooperativity. Further, the hydrophobic residues subnetworks in long- and all-range networks have similar transition behaviours with all residues all-range networks, but the hydrophilic and charged residues networks don't. While the nature of transitions of LCC's sizes is same in SRNs for thermophiles and mesophiles, there exists a clear difference in LRNs. The presence of larger size of interconnected long-range interactions in thermophiles than mesophiles, even at higher interaction strength between amino acids, give extra stability to the tertiary structure of the thermophiles. All the subnetworks at different length scales (ARNs, LRNs and SRNs) show assortativity mixing property of their participating amino acids. While there exists a significant higher percentage of hydrophobic subclusters over others in ARNs and LRNs; we do not find the assortative mixing behaviour of any the subclusters in SRNs. The clustering coefficient of hydrophobic subclusters in long-range network is the highest among types of subnetworks. There exist highly cliquish hydrophobic nodes followed by charged nodes in LRNs and ARNs; on the other hand, we observe the highest dominance of charged residues cliques in short-range networks. Studies on the perimeter of the cliques also show higher occurrences of hydrophobic and charged residues' cliques.
The simple framework of protein contact networks and their subnetworks based on London van der Waals force is able to capture several known properties of protein structure as well as can unravel several new features. The thermophiles do not only have the higher number of long-range interactions; they also have larger cluster of connected residues at higher interaction strengths among amino acids, than their mesophilic counterparts. It can reestablish the significant role of long-range hydrophobic clusters in protein folding and stabilization; at the same time, it shed light on the higher communication ability of hydrophobic subnetworks over the others. The results give an indication of the controlling role of hydrophobic subclusters in determining protein's folding rate. The occurrences of higher perimeters of hydrophobic and charged cliques imply the role of charged residues as well as hydrophobic residues in stabilizing the distant part of primary structure of a protein through London van der Waals interaction.},

abstract = {Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common primary cardiac disorder defined as the presence of a hypertrophied left ventricle in the absence of any other diagnosed etiology. HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people which often occurs without precedent symptoms. The overall clinical phenotype of patients with HCM is broad, ranging from a complete lack of cardiovascular symptoms to exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and sudden death, often due to arrhythmias. To date, 270 independent mutations in nine sarcomeric protein genes have been linked to Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (FHC), thus the clinical variability is matched by significant genetic heterogeneity. While the final clinical phenotype in patients with FHC is a result of multiple factors including modifier genes, environmental influences and genotype, initial screening studies had suggested that individual gene mutations could be linked to specific prognoses. Given that the sarcomeric genes linked to FHC encode proteins with known functions, a vast array of biochemical, biophysical and physiologic experimental approaches have been applied to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of this complex cardiovascular disorder. In this review, to illustrate the basic relationship between protein dysfunction and disease pathogenesis we focus on representative gene mutations from each of the major structural components of the cardiac sarcomere: the thick filament (beta MyHC), the thin filament (cTnT and Tm) and associated proteins (MyBP-C). The results of these studies will lead to a better understanding of FHC and eventually identify targets for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {The intracellular calcium ion is one of the most important secondary messengers in eukaryotic cells. Ca(2+) signals are translated into physiological responses by EF-hand calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin (CaM). Multiple CaM isoforms occur in plant cells, whereas only a single CaM protein is found in animals. Soybean CaM isoform 1 (sCaM1) shares 90{\%} amino acid sequence identity with animal CaM (aCaM), whereas sCaM4 is only 78{\%} identical. These two sCaM isoforms have distinct target-enzyme activation properties and physiological functions. sCaM4 is highly expressed during the self-defense reaction of the plant and activates the enzyme nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), whereas sCaM1 is incapable of activating NOS. The mechanism of selective target activation by plant CaM isoforms is poorly understood. We have determined high resolution NMR solution structures of Ca(2+)-sCaM1 and -sCaM4. These were compared with previously determined Ca(2+)-aCaM structures. For the N-lobe of the protein, the solution structures of Ca(2+)-sCaM1, -sCaM4, and -aCaM all closely resemble each other. However, despite the high sequence identity with aCaM, the C-lobe of Ca(2+)-sCaM1 has a more open conformation and consequently a larger hydrophobic target-protein binding pocket than Ca(2+)-aCaM or -sCaM4, the presence of which was further confirmed through biophysical measurements. The single Val-144 --{\textgreater} Met substitution in the C-lobe of Ca(2+)-sCaM1, which restores its ability to activate NOS, alters the structure of the C-lobe to a more closed conformation resembling Ca(2+)-aCaM and -sCaM4. The relationships between the structural differences in the two Ca(2+)-sCaM isoforms and their selective target activation properties are discussed.},

abstract = {Human cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) is the first sarcomeric protein for which mutations have been associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy. To determine whether five mutations in cTnI (L144Q, R145W, A171T, K178E, and R192H) associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy were distinguishable from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in cTnI, actomyosin ATPase activity and skinned fiber studies were carried out. All five mutations investigated showed an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with wildtype cTnI. The two mutations with the worst clinical phenotype (K178E and R192H) both showed large increases in Ca2+ sensitivity (Delta pCa(50) = 0.47 and 0.36, respectively). Although at least one of these mutations is not in the known inhibitory regions of cTnI, all of the mutations investigated caused a decrease in the ability of cTnI to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant cTnI showed that cTnI mutants could be classified into three different groups: dominant (L144Q, A171T and R192H), equivalent (K178E), or weaker (R145W) than wild-type cTnI in actomyosin ATPase assays in the absence of Ca2+. Although most of the mutants were able to activate actomyosin ATPase similarly to wild-type cTnI, L144Q had significantly lower maximal ATPase activities than any of the other mutants or wild-type cTnI. Three mutants (L144Q, R145W, and K178E) were unable to fully relax contraction in the absence of Ca2+. The inability of the five cTnI mutations investigated to fully inhibit ATPase activity/force development and the generally larger increases in Ca2+ sensitivity than observed for most hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations would likely lead to severe diastolic dysfunction and may be the major physiological factors responsible for causing the restrictive cardiomyopathy phenotype in some of the genetically affected individuals.},

The chemical potential of solute contains contributions from excluded volume, polarization, and dispersion forces. The polarization of the gas particle is calculated explicitly within the framework of the mean spherical approximation for the ion–dipole mixture. An additional contribution originating from the polarization of the salt is proposed. This effect has been overlooked in previous theoretical studies. Its magnitude is estimated in an approximate way. The description is found to give predictions that are in good agreement with experimental solubility data for noble gases and water in molten KCl and RbCl. The results suggest that volume exclusion and salt polarization may constitute the main two opposing factors affecting this phenomenon.},

It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.},

abstract = {Time-resolved single-molecule biophysical experiments yield data that contain a wealth of dynamic information, in addition to the equilibrium distributions derived from histograms of the time series. In typical force spectroscopic setups the molecule is connected via linkers to a readout device, forming a mechanically coupled dynamic network. Deconvolution of equilibrium distributions, filtering out the influence of the linkers, is a straightforward and common practice. We have developed an analogous dynamic deconvolution theory for the more challenging task of extracting kinetic properties of individual components in networks of arbitrary complexity and topology. Our method determines the intrinsic linear response functions of a given object in the network, describing the power spectrum of conformational fluctuations. The practicality of our approach is demonstrated for the particular case of a protein linked via DNA handles to two optically trapped beads at constant stretching force, which we mimic through Brownian dynamics simulations. Each well in the protein free energy landscape (corresponding to folded, unfolded, or possibly intermediate states) will have its own characteristic equilibrium fluctuations. The associated linear response function is rich in physical content, because it depends both on the shape of the well and its diffusivity-a measure of the internal friction arising from such processes as the transient breaking and reformation of bonds in the protein structure. Starting from the autocorrelation functions of the equilibrium bead fluctuations measured in this force clamp setup, we show how an experimentalist can accurately extract the state-dependent protein diffusivity using a straightforward two-step procedure.},

@article{Gifford2007,
abstract = {The 'EF-hand' Ca2+-binding motif plays an essential role in eukaryotic cellular signalling, and the proteins containing this motif constitute a large and functionally diverse family. The EF-hand is defined by its helix-loop-helix secondary structure as well as the ligands presented by the loop to bind the Ca2+ ion. The identity of these ligands is semi-conserved in the most common (the 'canonical') EF-hand; however, several non-canonical EF-hands exist that bind Ca2+ by a different co-ordination mechanism. EF-hands tend to occur in pairs, which form a discrete domain so that most family members have two, four or six EF-hands. This pairing also enables communication, and many EF-hands display positive co-operativity, thereby minimizing the Ca2+ signal required to reach protein saturation. The conformational effects of Ca2+ binding are varied, function-dependent and, in some cases, minimal, but can lead to the creation of a protein target interaction site or structure formation from a molten-globule apo state. EF-hand proteins exhibit various sensitivities to Ca2+, reflecting the intrinsic binding ability of the EF-hand as well as the degree of co-operativity in Ca2+ binding to paired EF-hands. Two additional factors can influence the ability of an EF-hand to bind Ca2+: selectivity over Mg2+ (a cation with very similar chemical properties to Ca2+ and with a cytoplasmic concentration several orders of magnitude higher) and interaction with a protein target. A structural approach is used in this review to examine the diversity of family members, and a biophysical perspective provides insight into the ability of the EF-hand motif to bind Ca2+ with a wide range of affinities.},

abstract = {To clarify the extensibility of thin actin and thick myosin filaments in muscle, we examined the spacings of actin and myosin filament-based reflections in x-ray diffraction patterns at high resolution during isometric contraction of frog skeletal muscles and steady lengthening of the active muscles using synchrotron radiation as an intense x-ray source and a storage phosphor plate as a high sensitivity, high resolution area detector. Spacing of the actin meridional reflection at approximately 1/2.7 nm-1, which corresponds to the axial rise per actin subunit in the thin filament, increased about 0.25{\%} during isometric contraction of muscles at full overlap length of thick and thin filaments. The changes in muscles stretched to approximately half overlap of the filaments, when they were scaled linearly up to the full isometric tension, gave an increase of approximately 0.3{\%}. Conversely, the spacing decreased by approximately 0.1{\%} upon activation of muscles at nonoverlap length. Slow stretching of a contracting muscle increased tension and increased this spacing over the isometric contraction value. Scaled up to a 100{\%} tension increase, this corresponds to a approximately 0.26{\%} additional change, consistent with that of the initial isometric contraction. Taken together, the extensibility of the actin filament amounts to 3-4 nm of elongation when a muscle switches from relaxation to maximum isometric contraction. Axial spacings of the layer-line reflections at approximately 1/5.1 nm-1 and approximately 1/5.9 nm-1 corresponding to the pitches of the right- and left-handed genetic helices of the actin filament, showed similar changes to that of the meridional reflection during isometric contraction of muscles at full overlap. The spacing changes of these reflections, which also depend on the mechanical load on the muscle, indicate that elongation is accompanied by slight changes of the actin helical structure possibly because of the axial force exerted by the actomyosin cross-bridges. Additional small spacing changes of the myosin meridional reflections during length changes applied to contracting muscles represented an increase of approximately 0.26{\%} (scaled up to a 100{\%} tension increase) in the myosin periodicity, suggesting that such spacing changes correspond to a tension-related extension of the myosin filaments. Elongation of the myosin filament backbone amounts to approximately 2.1 nm per half sarcomere. The results indicate that a large part (approximately 70{\%}) of the sarcomere compliance of an active muscle is caused by the extensibility of the actin and myosin filaments; 42{\%} of the compliance resides in the actin filaments, and 27{\%} of it is in the myosin filaments.},

abstract = {Objective: The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether activation of Na influx via voltage-gated Na channels can elevate sub-sarcolemmal ('fuzzy-space') [Na] and transiently activate Na/K pump current (I"p). Methods and results: Initially, Na/K pump activity was characterised in whole-cell voltage-clamped single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. I"p was activated by intracellular Na with a K"m of 15.5 mM and a Hill coefficient of 1.7. Extracellular K activated I"p with a K"m of 1.6 mM. In these experiments, a finite ouabain-sensitive I"p was measured when the pipette [Na] was zero. This suggests that there is an accumulation of Na in a sub-sarcolemmal space that is not in equilibrium with the bulk cytosol (which is assumed to be efficiently dialysed by the low-resistance patch-pipettes used). Such a sub-sarcolemmal Na gradient was observed in separate experiments in intact rabbit papillary muscles using electron probe X-ray microanalysis. In these studies, a fuzzy-space of limited Na diffusion was observed 100-200 nm below the sarcolemmal membrane. This sub-sarcolemmal Na gradient was similar whether muscles were frozen at peak-systole or end-diastole suggesting that the fuzzy-space Na does not change over the course of the contractile cycle. This was further investigated in isolated guinea pig myocytes where evidence for a transient activation of I"p was sought immediately after the activation of voltage-gated Na channels. A single clamp step from -80 to 0 mV activated Na influx but, in the 10-2000 ms immediately following the initial Na influx no evidence for a transient activation of I"p was observed. Similarly, no activation of I"p could be detected immediately following a train of 20 rapid (5-Hz) pulses designed to maximise Na influx. Conclusions: These studies provide evidence for the existence of a maintained sub-sarcolemmal elevation of [Na] in ventricular myocardium; however, this fuzzy-space [Na] did not change immediately after the activation of Na influx via voltage-gated Na channels or throughout the contractile cycle.},

Structure-based electrostatics calculations are essential for this purpose, but their use have been limited by a long-standing discussion on which value to use for the dielectric constants ($\epsilon$eff and $\epsilon$p) required in Coulombic models and Poisson-Boltzmann models. The currently used values for $\epsilon$eff and $\epsilon$p are essentially empirical parameters calibrated against thermo-dynamic properties that are indirect measurements of protein electric fields. We determine optimal values for $\epsilon$eff and $\epsilon$p by measuring protein electric fields in solution using direct detection of NMR chemical shift perturbations (CSPs). We measured CSPs in fourteen proteins to get a broad and general characterization of electric fields. Coulomb's law reproduces the measured CSPs optimally with a protein dielectric constant ($\epsilon$eff) from 3 to 13, with an optimal value across all proteins of 6.5. However, when the wate...},

abstract = {The thermal behavior of lithium ion batteries has a huge impact on their lifetime and the initiation of degradation processes. The development of hot spots or large local overpotentials leading, e.g., to lithium metal deposition depends on material properties as well as on the nano- und microstructure of the electrodes. In recent years a theoretical structure emerges, which opens the possibility to establish a systematic modeling strategy from atomistic to continuum scale to capture and couple the relevant phenomena on each scale. We outline the building blocks for such a systematic approach and discuss in detail a rigorous approach for the continuum scale based on rational thermodynamics and homogenization theories. Our focus is on the development of a systematic thermodynamically consistent theory for thermal phenomena in batteries at the microstructure scale and at the cell scale. We discuss the importance of carefully defining the continuum fields for being able to compare seemingly different phenomenological theories and for obtaining rules to determine unknown parameters of the theory by experiments or lower-scale theories. The resulting continuum models for the microscopic and the cell scale are numerically solved in full 3D resolution. The complex very localized distributions of heat sources in a microstructure of a battery and the problems of mapping these localized sources on an averaged porous electrode model are discussed by comparing the detailed 3D microstructure-resolved simulations of the heat distribution with the result of the upscaled porous electrode model. It is shown, that not all heat sources that exist on the microstructure scale are represented in the averaged theory due to subtle cancellation effects of interface and bulk heat sources. Nevertheless, we find that in special cases the averaged thermal behavior can be captured very well by porous electrode theory.},

abstract = {Confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence imaging was used to examine the distribution of caveolin-3, sodium-calcium exchange (NCX) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in rat ventricular myocytes. Transverse and longitudinal optical sectioning shows that NCX is distributed widely along the transverse and longitudinal tubular system (t-system). The NCX labeling consisted of both punctate and distributed components, which partially colocalize with RyRs (27{\%}). Surface membrane labeling showed a similar pattern but the fraction of RyR clusters containing NCX label was decreased and no non-punctate labeling was observed. Sixteen percent of RyRs were not colocalized with the t-system and 1.6{\%} of RyRs were found on longitudinal elements of the t-system. The surface distribution of RyR labeling was not generally consistent with circular patches of RyRs. This suggests that previous estimates for the number of RyRs in a junction (based on circular close-packed arrays) need to be revised. The observed distribution of caveolin-3 labeling was consistent with its exclusion from RyR clusters. Distance maps for all colocalization pairs were calculated to give the distance between centroids of punctate labeling and edges for distributed components. The possible roles for punctate NCX labeling are discussed.},

Proteins historically embraced within this group include parvalbumins (alpha and beta), calbindin-D9k, calbindin-D28k and calretinin. Within the last few years a wealth of data has accumulated that allow a better understanding of the functions of particular family members of the {\textgreater}240 identified EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding proteins encoded by the human genome. Studies often involving transgenic animal models have revealed that they exert their specific functions within an intricate network consisting of many proteins and cellular mechanisms involved in Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+) homeostasis, and are thus an essential part of the Ca(2+) homeostasome. Recent results indicate that calbindin-D28k, possibly also calretinin and oncomodulin, the mammalian beta parvalbumin, might have additional Ca(2+) sensor functions, leaving parvalbumin and calbindin-D9k as the only "pure" Ca(2+) buffers.},

A major challenge in these efforts is how to bridge spatial and temporal scales over many orders of magnitude. Furthermore, there are additional challenges in integrating different aspects ranging from questions about biomolecular stability in crowded environments to the description of reactive processes on cellular scales. In this review, recent studies with models of biomolecules in cellular environments at different levels of detail are discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, atomistic models, implicit representations of cellular environments, coarse-grained and spheroidal models of biomolecules, as well as the inclusion of reactive processes via reaction-diffusion models are described. Furthermore, strategies for integrating the different models into a comprehensive description of cellular environments are discussed.

@article{Espinoza-Fonseca2011,
abstract = {We have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate, in atomic detail, the mechanism by which the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is activated by Ca2+. Crystal structures suggest that activation of SERCA occurs when the cytoplasmic head-piece, in an open (E1) conformation stabilized by Ca2+, undergoes a large-scale open-to-closed (E1 to E2) transition that is induced by ATP binding. However, spectroscopic measurements in solution suggest that these structural states (E1 and E2) are not tightly coupled to biochemical states (defined by bound ligands); the closed E2 state predominates even in the absence of ATP, in both the presence and absence of Ca2+. How is this loose coupling consistent with the high efficiency of energy transduction in the Ca2+-ATPase? To provide insight into this question, we performed long (500 ns) all-atom MD simulations starting from the open crystal structure, including a lipid bilayer and water. In both the presence and absence of Ca2+, we observed a large-scale open-to-closed conformational transition within 400 ns, supporting the weak coupling between structural and biochemical states. However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that Ca2+ is necessary and sufficient for SERCA to reach the precise geometrical arrangement necessary for activation of ATP hydrolysis. Contrary to suggestions from crystal structures, but in agreement with solution spectroscopy, the presence of ATP is not required for this activating transition. Principal component analysis showed that Ca2+ reshapes the free energy landscape of SERCA to create a path between the open conformation and the activated closed conformation. Thus the malleability of the free energy landscape is essential for SERCA efficiency, ensuring that ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to Ca2+ transport. These results demonstrate the importance of real-time dynamics in the formation of catalytically competent conformations of SERCA, with broad implications for understanding enzymatic catalysis in atomic detail.},

@article{Carafoli2002,
abstract = {An experiment performed in London nearly 120 years ago, which by today's standards would be considered unacceptably sloppy, marked the beginning of the calcium (Ca2+) signaling saga. Sidney Ringer [Ringer, S. (1883) J. Physiol. 4, 29-43] was studying the contraction of isolated rat hearts. In earlier experiments, Ringer had suspended them in a saline medium for which he admitted to having used London tap water, which is hard: The hearts contracted beautifully. When he proceeded to replace the tap water with distilled water, he made a startling finding: The beating of the hearts became progressively weaker, and stopped altogether after about 20 min. To maintain contraction, he found it necessary to add Ca2+ salts to the suspension medium. Thus, Ringer had serendipitously discovered that Ca2+, hitherto exclusively considered as a structural element, was active in a tissue that has nothing to do with bone or teeth, and performed there a completely novel function: It carried the signal that initiated heart contraction. It was a landmark observation, which should have immediately aroused wide interest. Unexpectedly, however, for decades it attracted no particular attention. occasionally, farsighted pioneers argued forcefully for a messenger role of Ca2+, offering compelling experimental evidence. Among them, one could quote L. V. Heilbrunn [Heilbrunn, L. V. (1940) Physiol. Zool. 13, 88-94], who contracted frog muscle fibers by applying Ca2+ salts to their cut ends, but not to their surfaces. Heilbrunn correctly concluded that Ca2+ had diffused from the cut ends to the internal contractile elements to elicit their contraction. One could also quote K. Bailey [Bailey, K. (1942) Biochem. J. 36, 121-139], who showed that the ATPase activity of myosin was strongly activated by Ca2+ (but not by Mg2+), and concluded that the liberation of Ca2+ in the neighborhood of the myosin controlled muscle contraction. Clearly, enough evidence was there, but only a handful of people had the vision to see it and to foresee its far-reaching implications. Perhaps no better example of clairvoyance can be offered than the quip by O. Loewy in 1959: "Ja Kalzium, das ist alles!"},

abstract = {Single channel currents through cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channels were measured in very low levels of current carrier (e.g., 1 mM Ba2+). The hypothesis that surface charge contributes to these anomalously large single channel currents was tested by changing ionic strength and surface charge density. Channel identity and sidedness was pharmacologically determined. At low ionic strength (20 mM Cs+), Cs+ conduction in the lumen--{\textgreater}myoplasm (L--{\textgreater}M) direction was significantly greater than in the reverse direction (301.7 +/- 92.5 vs 59.8 +/- 38 pS, P {\textless} 0.001; mean +/- SD, t test). The Cs+ concentration at which conduction reached half saturation was asymmetric (32 vs 222 mM) and voltage independent. At high ionic strength (400 mM Cs+), conduction in both direction saturated at 550 +/- 32 pS. Further, neutralization of carboxyl groups on the lumenal side of the channel significantly reduced conduction (333.0 +/- 22.5 vs 216.2 +/- 24.4 pS, P {\textless} 0.002). These results indicate that negative surface charge exists near the lumenal mouth of the channel but outside the electric field of the membrane. In vivo, this surface charge may potentiate conduction by increasing the local Ca2+ concentration and thus act as a preselection filter for this poorly selective channel.},

abstract = {In heart failure (HF) a main factor in reduced contractility is reduced SR Ca2+ content and reversed force-frequency response (FFR), ie, from positive to negative. Our arrhythmogenic rabbit HF model exhibits decreased contractility mainly due to an increase in Na/Ca exchange (NCX) activity ( with only modest decrease in SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) function), similar to many end-stage HF patients. Here we test whether phospholamban (PLB) inhibition using a dominant-negative mutant PLB adenovirus (K3E/R14E, AdPLB-dn, with beta-galactosidase adenovirus as control) could enhance SERCA function and restore Ca2+ transients and positive FFR in ventricular myocytes from these HF rabbits. HF myocytes infected with AdPLB-dn ( versus control) had enhanced Ca2+ transient amplitude (2.0 +/- 0.1 versus 1.6 +/- 0.05 F/F-o at 0.5 Hz, P{\textless} 0.05) and had a positive FFR, whereas acutely isolated HF myocytes or those infected with Ad beta gal had negative FFR. Ca2+ transients declined faster in AdPLB-dn versus Ad beta gal myocytes (RT50{\%}: 317 +/- 29 versus 551 +/- 90 ms at 0.5 Hz, P{\textless} 0.05) and had an increased SR Ca2+ load ( 3.5 +/- 0.3 versus 2.6 +/- 0.2 F/F-o at 0.5 Hz, P{\textless} 0.05), indicative of increased SERCA function. Furthermore, this restoration of function was not due to changes in NCX or SERCA expression. Thus, increasing SERCA activity in failing myocytes by AdPLB-dn gene transfer reversed the contractile dysfunction ( and restored positive FFR) by increasing SR Ca2+ load. This approach could enhance contractile function in failing hearts of various etiologies, even here where reduced SERCA activity is not the main dysfunction.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have become a standard tool for the investigation of biological and soft matter systems. Water models serve as the basis of force fields used in molecular dynamics simulations of these systems. This article reports on an examination of the utility of a set of coarse-grained (CG) water models, with different resolutions, interaction potentials (Lennard-Jones, Morse), and cut-off distances. The relationships between the parameters under specific choices of the above options and the thermodynamic properties, such as density, surface tension, and compressibility, were found to fit simple mathematical equations. The limits of applicability of these CG water models were explored by checking the melting temperature. If a CG site is mapped to one or two real water molecules, a simple model with appropriate combinations of cut-off distances, functional forms, and parameters can be found to simultaneously match the experimental values of density, surface tension, and compressibility under ambient conditions. If more water molecules are included in a CG site, either the melting temperature approaches or surpasses room temperature, or the surface tension and compressibility cannot both be matched simultaneously. In striving for computational efficiency, it is still possible to find a simple CG water model with three water molecules contained in a CG bead that generates a liquid state of water with realistic values of density, surface tension and compressibility at ambient condition, but coarser models are not recommended.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms by which protein Ca(II) sites selectively bind Ca(II) even in the presence of high concentrations of other metals, particularly Na(I), K(I), and Mg(II), have not been fully described. The single Ca(II) site of the Escherichia coli receptor for D-galactose and D-glucose (GGR) is structurally related to the eukaryotic EF-hand Ca(II) sites and is ideally suited as a model for understanding the structural and electrostatic basis of Ca(II) specificity. Metal binding to the bacterial site was monitored by a Tb(III) phosphorescence assay: Ca(II) in the site was replaced with Tb(III), which was then selectively excited by energy transfer from protein tryptophans. Photons emitted from the bound Tb(III) enabled specific detection of this substrate; for other metals binding was detected by competitive displacement of Tb(III). Representative spherical metal ions from groups IA, IIA, and IIIA and the lanthanides were chosen to study the effects of metal ion size and charge on the affinity of metal binding. A dissociation constant was measured for each metal, yielding a range of KD's spanning over 6 orders of magnitude. Monovalent metal ions of group IA exhibited very low affinities. Divalent group IIA metal ions exhibited affinities related to their size, with optimal binding at an effective ionic radius between those of Mg(II) (0.81 A) and Ca(II) (1.06 A). Trivalent metal ions of group IIIA and the lanthanides also exhibited size-dependent affinities, with an optimal effective ionic radius between those of Sc(III) (0.81 A) and Yb(III) (0.925 A). The results indicate that the GGR site selects metal ions on the basis of both charge and size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

However, for a receptor with more than one ligand binding site, the Hill equation does not reflect a physically possible reaction scheme; only under the very specific condition of marked positive cooperativity does the Hill coefficient accurately estimate the number of binding sites. The Hill coefficient is best thought of as an "interaction" coefficient, reflecting the extent of cooperativity among multiple ligand binding sites. Several relatively simple, physically plausible reaction schemes are shown here to produce a variety of ligand dose-response curve phenotypes more appropriately suited to modeling ligand-receptor interactions, especially if independent information about the stochiometry of the ligand-receptor interaction is available.},

abstract = {The determinants of relaxation in cardiac muscle are poorly understood, yet compromised relaxation accompanies various pathologies and impaired pump function. In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate the relative importance of the [Ca2+](i) transient magnitude, the unbinding of Ca2+ from troponin C (TnC), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca2+ sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca2+ to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca2+, isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca2+](i) transient and the unbinding of Ca2+ from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca2+ to TnC and length-dependent Ca2+ sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca2(+)](i) transient and the unbinding rate of Ca2+ from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca2(+)](i) transient and unbinding rate.},

We show here that nanomolar concentrations of beta-catecholamines cause hyperpolarization of cardiac Purkinje fibres, not by increasing Na+/K+ pump current, but by increasing resting membrane K+ conductance. The hyperpolarization and shortening of the action potential should increase availability of Na+ channels and reduce the refractory period, effects tending to safeguard impulse propagation through the ventricular conducting system despite the increased heart rate caused by beta-catecholamine action on the sinus node pacemaker.},

Here we use transmission electron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets and specific probes to show that most or all plasma membrane-associated proteins are clustered in cholesterol-enriched domains ("islands") that are separated by "protein-free" and cholesterol-low membrane. These islands are further divided into subregions, as shown by the localization of "raft" and "non-raft" markers to specific areas. Abundant actin staining and inhibitor studies show that these structures are connected to the cytoskeleton and at least partially depend on it for their formation and/or maintenance.},

abstract = {Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is a highly coordinated process that is controlled by protein kinase signaling pathways, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A (PKA). Increased CaMKII expression and activity (as occurs during heart failure) destabilizes EC coupling and may lead to sudden cardiac death. To better understand mechanisms of cardiac CaMKII function, we integrated dynamic CaMKII-dependent regulation of key Ca2+ handling targets with previously validated models of cardiac EC coupling, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation of CaMKII, and beta-adrenergic activation of PKA. Model predictions are validated against CaMKII-overexpression data from rabbit ventricular myocytes. The model demonstrates how overall changes to Ca2+ handling during CaMKII overexpression are explained by interactions between individual CaMKII substrates. CaMKII and PKA activities during beta-adrenergic stimulation may synergistically facilitate inotropic responses and contribute to a CaMKII-Ca2+-CaMKII feedback loop. CaMKII regulated early frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation and EC coupling gain (which was highly sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load-dependent). Additionally, the model identifies CaMKII-dependent ryanodine receptor hyperphosphorylation as a proarrhythmogenic trigger. In summary, we developed a detailed computational model of CaMKII and PKA signaling. in cardiac myocytes that provides unique insights into their regulation of normal and pathological Ca2+ handling.},

abstract = {Activation of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (mitoKATP) channels is critical in myocardial protection induced by preconditioning with volatile anesthetics or brief periods of ischemia. In this study, we characterized rat mitoKATP channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers and examined their direct regulation by isoflurane. Mitochondria and the inner membrane fraction were isolated from rat ventricles and fused into lipid bilayers. On the basis of their inhibition by 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD)/ATP or activation by diazoxide, mitoKATP channels of several conductance states were observed in symmetrical (150 mM) potassium glutamate (26, 47, 66, 83, and 105 pS). Isoflurane (0.8 mM) increased the cumulative open probability from 0.09 ± 0.02 at baseline to 0.50 ± 0.09 ( P {\textless} 0.05, n = 5), which was inhibited by 5-HD. Isoflurane caused a dose-dependent rightward shift in ATP inhibition of mitoKATP channels, which increased the IC50 for ATP from 335 ± 4 to 940 ± 34 $\mu$M at 0.8 mM ( P {\textless} 0.05, n = 5∼8). We conclude that direct activation of the mitoKATP channel by isoflurane is likely to contribute to volatile anesthetic-induced myocardial preconditioning.},

abstract = {Rationale: beta-Adrenergic receptor stimulation produces sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ overload and delayed afterdepolarizations in isolated ventricular myocytes. How delayed afterdepolarizations are synchronized to overcome the source-sink mismatch and produce focal arrhythmia in the intact heart remains unknown.Objective: To determine whether local beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation produces spatiotemporal synchronization of delayed afterdepolarizations and to examine the effects of tissue geometry and cell-cell coupling on the induction of focal arrhythmia.Methods and Results: Simultaneous optical mapping of transmembrane potential and Ca2+ transients was performed in normal rabbit hearts during subepicardial injections (50 mu L) of norepinephrine (NE) or control (normal Tyrode's solution). Local NE produced premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) from the injection site that were dose-dependent (low-dose [30-60 mu mol/L], 0.45+/-0.62 PVCs per injection; high-dose [125-250 mu mol/L], 1.33+/-1.46 PVCs per injection; P{\textless}0.0001) and were inhibited by propranolol. NE-induced PVCs exhibited abnormal voltage-Ca2+ delay at the initiation site and were inhibited by either sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibition or reduced perfusate [Ca2+], which indicates a Ca2+-mediated mechanism. NE-induced PVCs were more common at right ventricular than at left ventricular sites (1.48+/-1.50 versus 0.55+/-0.89, P{\textless}0.01), and this was unchanged after chemical ablation of endocardial Purkinje fibers, which suggests that source-sink interactions may contribute to the greater propensity to right ventricular PVCs. Partial gap junction uncoupling with carbenoxolone (25 mu mol/L) increased focal activity (2.18+/-1.43 versus 1.33+/-1.46 PVCs per injection, P{\textless}0.05), which further supports source-sink balance as a critical mediator of Ca2+-induced PVCs.Conclusions: These data provide the first experimental demonstration that localized beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation produces spatiotemporal synchronization of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ overload and release in the intact heart and highlight the critical nature of source-sink balance in initiating focal arrhythmias.

abstract = {The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) may influence cardiac function depending on its predominant mode of action, forward mode or reverse mode, during the contraction-relaxation cycle. The intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+](i)) and the duration of the action potential as well as the level of NCX protein expression regulate the mode of action of NCX. [Na+](i) and NCX expression have been reported to be increased in human heart failure. Nevertheless, the consequences of altered NCX expression in heart failure are still a matter of discussion. We aimed to characterize the influence of NCX expression on intracellular Ca2+ transport in rat cardiomyocytes by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer. A five- to ninefold ( dose dependent) overexpression of NCX protein was achieved after 48 h by somatic gene transfer (Ad. NCX. GFP) versus control (Ad. GFP). NCX activity, determined by Na+ gradient-dependent Ca-45(2+)-uptake, was significantly increased. The protein expressions of sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, phospholamban, and calsequestrin were unaffected by NCX overexpression. Fractional shortening (FS) of isolated cardiomyocytes was significantly increased at low stimulation rates in Ad. NCX. GFP. After a step-wise enhancing frequency of stimulation to 3.0 Hz, FS remained unaffected in Ad. GFP cells but declined in Ad. NCX. GFP cells. The positive inotropic effect of the cardiac glycoside ouabain was less effective in Ad. NCX. GFP cells, whereas the positive inotropic effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation remained unchanged. In conclusion, NCX overexpression results in a reduced cell shortening at higher stimulation frequencies as well as after inhibition of sarcolemmal Na+-K+-ATPase, i. e., in conditions with enhanced [Na+](i). At low stimulation rates, increased NCX expression enhances both intracellular systolic Ca2+ and contraction amplitude.},

@article{Eisenberg2010,
abstract = {Ionic solutions are mixtures of interacting anions and cations. They hardly resemble dilute gases of uncharged noninteracting point particles described in elementary textbooks. Biological and electrochemical solutions have many components that interact strongly as they flow in concentrated environments near electrodes, ion channels, or active sites of enzymes. Interactions in concentrated environments help determine the characteristic properties of electrodes, enzymes, and ion channels. Flows are driven by a combination of electrical and chemical potentials that depend on the charges, concentrations, and sizes of all ions, not just the same type of ion. We use a variational method EnVarA (energy variational analysis) that combines Hamilton's least action and Rayleigh's dissipation principles to create a variational field theory that includes flow, friction, and complex structure with physical boundary conditions. EnVarA optimizes both the action integral functional of classical mechanics and the dissipation functional. These functionals can include entropy and dissipation as well as potential energy. The stationary point of the action is determined with respect to the trajectory of particles. The stationary point of the dissipation is determined with respect to rate functions (such as velocity). Both variations are written in one Eulerian (laboratory) framework. In variational analysis, an "extra layer" of mathematics is used to derive partial differential equations. Energies and dissipations of different components are combined in EnVarA and Euler-Lagrange equations are then derived. These partial differential equations are the unique consequence of the contributions of individual components. The form and parameters of the partial differential equations are determined by algebra without additional physical content or assumptions. The partial differential equations of mixtures automatically combine physical properties of individual (unmixed) components. If a new component is added to the energy or dissipation, the Euler-Lagrange equations change form and interaction terms appear without additional adjustable parameters. EnVarA has previously been used to compute properties of liquid crystals, polymer fluids, and electrorheological fluids containing solid balls and charged oil droplets that fission and fuse. Here we apply EnVarA to the primitive model of electrolytes in which ions are spheres in a frictional dielectric. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equations include electrostatics and diffusion and friction. They are a time dependent generalization of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations of semiconductors, electrochemistry, and molecular biophysics. They include the finite diameter of ions. The EnVarA treatment is applied to ions next to a charged wall, where layering is observed. Applied to an ion channel, EnVarA calculates a quick transient pile-up of electric charge, transient and steady flow through the channel, stationary "binding" in the channel, and the eventual accumulation of salts in "unstirred layers" near channels. EnVarA treats electrolytes in a unified way as complex rather than simple fluids. Ad hoc descriptions of interactions and flow have been used in many areas of science to deal with the nonideal properties of electrolytes. It seems likely that the variational treatment can simplify, unify, and perhaps derive and improve those descriptions. (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3476262]},

abstract = {Small-angle x-ray solution scattering (SAXS) is analyzed with a new method to retrieve convergent model structures that fit the scattering profiles. An arbitrary hexagonal packing of several hundred beads containing the problem object is defined. Instead of attempting to compute the Debye formula for all of the possible mass distributions, a genetic algorithm is employed that efficiently searches the configurational space and evolves best-fit bead models. Models from different runs of the algorithm have similar or identical structures. The modeling resolution is increased by reducing the bead radius together with the search space in successive cycles of refinement. The method has been tested with protein SAXS (0.001 {\textless} S {\textless} 0.06 A(-1)) calculated from x-ray crystal structures, adding noise to the profiles. The models obtained closely approach the volumes and radii of gyration of the known structures, and faithfully reproduce the dimensions and shape of each of them. This includes finding the active site cavity of lysozyme, the bilobed structure of gamma-crystallin, two domains connected by a stalk in betab2-crystallin, and the horseshoe shape of pancreatic ribonuclease inhibitor. The low-resolution solution structure of lysozyme has been directly modeled from its experimental SAXS profile (0.003 {\textless} S {\textless} 0.03 A(-1)). The model describes lysozyme size and shape to the resolution of the measurement. The method may be applied to other proteins, to the analysis of domain movements, to the comparison of solution and crystal structures, as well as to large macromolecular assemblies.},

In the companion article (O'Rourke B, Kass DA, Tomaselli GF, Kaab S, Tunin R, Marban E. Mechanisms of altered excitation-contraction coupling in canine tachycardia-induced heart, I: experimental studies. Circ Res, 1999;84:562-570), O'Rourke et al show that Ca2+ transients recorded in myocytes isolated from canine hearts subjected to the tachycardia pacing protocol exhibit similar responses. Analyses of protein levels in these failing hearts reveal that both SR Ca2+ ATPase and phospholamban are decreased on average by 28{\%} and that Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) protein is increased on average by 104{\%}. In this article, we present a model of the canine midmyocardial ventricular action potential and Ca2+ transient. The model is used to estimate the degree of functional upregulation and downregulation of NCX and SR Ca2+ ATPase in heart failure using data obtained from 2 different experimental protocols. Model estimates of average SR Ca2+ ATPase functional downregulation obtained using these experimental protocols are 49{\%} and 62{\%}, Model estimates of average NCX functional upregulation range are 38{\%} and 75{\%}, Simulation of voltage-clamp Ca2+ transients indicates that such changes are sufficient to account for the reduced amplitude, altered shape, and slowed relaxation of Ca2+ transients in the failing canine heart. Model analyses also suggest that altered expression of Ca2+ handling proteins plays a significant role in prolongation of action potential duration in failing canine myocytes.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the relationship between the coordinating residues of the EF-hand calcium binding loop of parvalbumin and the overall plasticity and flexibility of the protein. The first simulation modeled the transition from Ca
2+ to Mg
2+ coordination by varying the van der Waals parameters for the bound metal ions. The glutamate at position 12 could be accurately and reversibly seen to be a source of selective bidentate ligation of Ca
2+ in the simulations. A second simulation correlated well with the experimental observation that an E101D substitution at EF loop position 12 results in a dramatically less tightly bound monodentate Ca
2+ coordination by aspartate. A final set of simulations investigated Ca
2+ binding in the E101D mutant loop in the presence of applied external forces designed to impose bidentate coordination. The results of these simulations illustrate that the aspartate is capable of attaining a suitable orientation for bidentate coordination, thus implying that it is the inherent rigidity of the loop that prevents bidentate coordination in the parvalbumin E101D mutant.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations based on detailed atomic models are used to examine the structure and dynamics of calbindin D9k, a protein possessing a pair of EF-hands able to bind two calcium ions in a cooperative fashion. Trajectories for the apo and singly (in the C-terminal binding site) and doubly loaded structures are generated and analyzed. Each system is solvated in a 27 A radius sphere of 2,285 explicit water molecules. The influence of the remaining bulk is incorporated through a stochastic boundary potential including a solvent reaction field. Long-range electrostatic interactions are treated with a special method and are not truncated. The average structural and dynamic properties upon calcium binding are studied at the atomic level to gain insight into the cooperative interactions between the two binding sites. Results from the trajectories are compared with data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. NMR 15N and 13C(alpha) backbone relaxation order parameters and crystallographic B-factors are calculated. Generally, there is a good qualitative agreement between calculated and observed properties. Results confirm that the doubly loaded state is closer, both structurally and dynamically, to the singly loaded state than either of these is to the apo state. It is observed that both hydrogen bonding and the packing of nonpolar side chains contribute to the coupling between the calcium binding sites. Two backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bonds linking the calcium-binding EF-hands (Leu23-0 ... HN-Val61 and Val61-O ... HN-Leu23) are sensitive to the state of occupancy. Residues Leu23 and Val61 exhibit the smallest rms fluctuations of the entire protein in the D state. In addition, the van der Waals interaction of Val61 with the rest of the protein varies with the calcium-binding state.},

This enables the selection of a smooth implicit solvation surface approximation to the Lee-Richards molecular surface. Next, a modified dual contouring method is used to extract triangular meshes for the surface, and tetrahedral meshes for the volume inside or outside the molecule within a bounding sphere/box of influence. Finally, geometric flow techniques are used to improve the surface and volume mesh quality. Several examples are presented, including generated meshes for biomolecules that have been successfully used in finite element simulations involving solvation energetics and binding rate constants.},

abstract = {A general framework is presented for the interpretation of NMR relaxation data of proteins. The method, termed isotropic reorientational eigenmode dynamics (iRED), relies on a principal component analysis of the isotropically averaged covariance matrix of the lattice functions of the spin interactions responsible for spin relaxation. The covariance matrix, which is evaluated using a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, is diagonalized yielding reorientational eigenmodes and amplitudes that reveal detailed information about correlated protein dynamics. The eigenvalue distribution allows one to quantitatively assess whether overall and internal motions are statistically separable. To each eigenmode belongs a correlation time that can be adjusted to optimally reproduce experimental relaxation parameters. A key feature of the method is that it does not require separability of overall tumbling and internal motions, which makes it applicable to a wide range of systems, such as folded, partially folded, and unfolded biomolecular systems and other macromolecules in solution. The approach was applied to NMR relaxation data of ubiquitin collected at multiple magnetic fields in the native form and in the partially folded A-state using MD trajectories with lengths of 6 and 70 ns. The relaxation data of native ubiquitin are well reproduced after adjustment of the correlation times of the 10 largest eigenmodes. For this state, a high degree of separability between internal and overall motions is present as is reflected in large amplitude and collectivity gaps between internal and overall reorientational modes. In contrast, no such separability exists for the A-state. Residual overall tumbling motion involving the N-terminal beta-sheet and the central helix is observed for two of the largest modes only. By adjusting the correlation times of the 10 largest modes, a high degree of consistency between the experimental relaxation data and the iRED model is reached for this highly flexible biomolecule.},

This work exploits temperature-controlled single-molecule FRET methods to address the thermodynamics of RNA folding pathways by probing the intramolecular docking/undocking kinetics of the ubiquitous GAAA tetraloop-receptor tertiary interaction as a function of [Mg(2+)]. These measurements yield the barrier and standard state enthalpies, entropies, and free energies for an RNA tertiary transition, in particular, revealing the thermodynamic origin of [Mg(2+)]-facilitated folding. Surprisingly, these studies reveal that increasing [Mg(2+)] promotes tetraloop-receptor interaction by reducing the entropic barrier ( ) and the overall entropic penalty ( ) for docking, with essentially negligible effects on both the activation enthalpy ( ) and overall exothermicity ( ). These observations contrast with the conventional notion that increasing [Mg(2+)] facilitates folding by minimizing electrostatic repulsion of opposing RNA helices, which would incorrectly predict a decrease in and with [Mg(2+)]. Instead we propose that higher [Mg(2+)] can aid RNA folding by decreasing the entropic penalty of counterion uptake and by reducing disorder of the unfolded conformational ensemble.},

abstract = {To characterize the dynamic behavior of calmodulin in solution, we have carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Ca2+-loaded structure. The crystal structure of calmodulin was placed in a solvent sphere of radius 44 Angstrom, and 6 Cl- and 22 Na+ ions were included to neutralize the system and to model a 150 mM salt concentration. The total number of atoms was 32,867. During the 3-ns simulation, the structure exhibits large conformational changes on the nanosecond time scale. The central alpha-helix, which has been shown to unwind locally upon binding of calmodulin to target proteins, bends and unwinds near residue Arg(74). We interpret this result as a preparative step in the more extensive structural transition observed in the "flexible linker" region 74-82 of the central helix upon complex formation. The major structural change is a reorientation of the two Ca2+-binding domains with respect to each other and a rearrangement of alpha-helices in the N-terminus domain that makes the hydrophobic target peptide binding site more accessible. This structural rearrangement brings the domains to a more favorable position for target binding, poised to achieve the orientation observed in the complex of calmodulin with myosin light-chain kinase. Analysis of solvent structure reveals an inhomogeneity in the mobility of water in the vicinity of the protein, which is attributable to the hydrophobic effect exerted by calmodulin's binding sites for target peptides.},

abstract = {It has been recognized in the last few years that unstructured proteins play an important role in biological organisms, often participating in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and a variety of other regulatory activities. Various hypotheses have been put forward for the ubiquity of the unfolded state; rapid turnover, faster or more specific binding kinetics, multifunctionality may all possibly explain apparent ubiquitousness of unfolded proteins in eukaryotic cells. In this paper we extend the energy landscape theory of protein folding to construct an analytical model of how binding and folding are coupled thermodynamically when the energy landscape is partially rugged. To deduce the parameters that enter the theory, which is based on Generalized Random Energy Model, we have analyzed in a bioinformatic sense a large structural database of more than 500 protein complexes. We find that Miyazawa-Jernigan contact potential shows similar energy gaps for folding for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic proteins, but that for binding contacts hydrophobic interfaces turn out to be funneled while hydrophilic ones are antifunneled. This suggests evolution has found a mechanism for avoiding frustration between folding and binding by making use of indirect water-mediated interactions. By juxtaposing the monomeric protein folding free energy profile in the protein complex database with another database consisting of only well-folded monomers, we estimate that at least 15{\%} of monomers in the former database are unfolded in the absence of partner protein interface interactions. When employing the parameters characteristic of these unfolded monomers to construct binding/folding phase diagrams, we find that these monomers would indeed fold if sufficiently stabilizing binding contacts, consistent with that fold, are formed.},

abstract = {The cardiac sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchanger (NCX) is allosterically regulated by [Ca](i) such that when [Ca](i) is low NCX current (I-NCX) deactivates. In this study we used membrane potential (E-m) and I-NCX to control Ca entry into and Ca efflux from intact cardiac myocytes to investigate whether this allosteric regulation (Ca activation) occurs with [Ca](i) in the physiological range. In the absence of Ca activation, the electrochemical effect of increasing [Ca](i) would be to increase inward I-NCX (Ca afflux) and to decrease outward I-NCX On the other hand, Ca activation would increase I-NCX in both directions. Thus, we attributed [Ca](i)-dependent increases in outward I-NCX to allosteric regulation, Ca activation of I-NCX was observed in ferret myocytes but not in wild-type mouse myocytes, suggesting that Ca regulation of NCX may be species dependent. We also studied transgenic mouse myocytes overexpressing either normal canine NCX or this same canine NCX lacking Ca regulation (Delta 680-685). Animals with the normal canine NCX transgene showed Ca activation, whereas animals with the mutant transgene did not, confirming the role of this region in the process. In native ferret cells and in mice with expressed canine NCS, allosteric regulation by Ca occurs under physiological conditions (K-mCaAct = 125 +/- 16 nM SEM approximate to resting [Ca](i)). This, along with the observation that no delay was observed between measured [Ca](i) and activation of INCX under our conditions, suggests that beat to beat changes in NCX function can occur in vivo. These changes in the I-NCX activation state may influence SR Ca load and resting [Ca](i), helping to fine tune Ca influx and efflux from cells under both normal and pathophysiological conditions. Our failure to observe Ca activation in mouse myocytes may be due to either the extent of Ca regulation or to a difference in K-mCaAct from other species.

abstract = {We present results of the restoration of all crystallographically available intra-and extracellular loops of four G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): bovine rhodopsin (bRh), the turkey beta-1 adrenergic receptor (beta 1Ar), and the human beta-2 adrenergic (beta 2Ar) and A2A adenosine (A2Ar) receptors. We use our Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP), which samples conformational space from first principles to build sets of loop candidates and then discriminates between them using our physics-based, all-atom energy function with implicit solvent. We also discuss a new kind of explicit membrane calculation developed for GPCR loops that interact, either in the native structure or in low-energy false-positive structures, with the membrane, and thus exist in a multiphase environment not previously incorporated in PLOP. Our results demonstrate a significant advance over previous work reported in the literature, and of particular note we are able to accurately restore the extremely long second extracellular loop (ECL2), which is also key for GPCR ligand binding. In the case of beta 2Ar, accurate ECL2 restoration required seeding a small helix into the loop in the appropriate region, based on alignment with the beta 1Ar ECL2 loop, and then running loop reconstruction simulations with and without the seeded helix present; simulations containing the helix attain significantly lower total energies than those without the helix, and have rmsds close to the native structure. For beta 1Ar, the same protocol was used, except the alignment was done to beta 2Ar. These results represent an encouraging start for the more difficult problem of accurate loop refinement for GPCR homology modeling.},

abstract = {Rat parvalbumin (PV), an EF-hand type Ca(2+)-binding protein, was expressed in Escherichia coli and mutated by replacing a Phe at position 102 with a unique Trp in order to introduce a distinct fluorescent label into the protein. Mass spectroscopy and NMR data indicate that the recombinant wild-type (PVWT) and F102W mutant (PVF102W) proteins have the expected molecular weight and retain the native structure. Both proteins contain two non-cooperative Ca2+/Mg(2+)-binding sites with intrinsic affinity constants, KCa and KMg, of 2.4 +/- 0.9 x 10(7) M-1 and of 2.9 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) M-1, respectively, for PVWT, and KCa and KMg, of 2.7 +/- 1.1 x 10(7) M-1 and of 4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(4) M-1, respectively, for PVF102W. Based on the highly similar metal binding properties of PVWT and PVF102W the latter protein was used to study cation-dependent conformational changes. Trp fluorescence emission and UV difference spectra of PVF102W indicated that the Trp residue at position 102 is confined to a hydrophobic core and conformationally strongly restricted. Upon Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding the structural organization of the region around the Trp is hardly affected, but there are significant changes in its electrostatic environment. The conformational change upon binding of Ca2+ and Mg2+, as monitored by UV difference spectrophotometry, increases linearly from 0 to 2 cations bound, indicating that the binding of both ions contributes equally to the structural organization in this protein.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial adenine nucleotide (AdN) content is regulated through the Ca(2+)-activated, electroneutral ATP-Mg/P(i) carrier (APC). The APC is a protein in the mitochondrial carrier super family that localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). It is known to modulate a number of processes that depend on mitochondrial AdN content, such as gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis, and citrulline synthesis. Despite this critical role, a kinetic model of the underlying mechanism has not been developed and validated. Here, a biophysical model of the APC is developed that is thermodynamically balanced and accurately reproduces a number of reported data sets from isolated rat liver and rat kidney mitochondria. The model is based on an ordered bi-bi mechanism for heteroexchange of ATP and P(i) and includes homoexchanges of ATP and P(i) to explain both the initial rate and time course data on ATP and P(i) transport via the APC. The model invokes seven kinetic parameters regarding the APC mechanism and three parameters related to matrix pH regulation by external P(i). These parameters are estimated based on 19 independent data curves; the estimated parameters are validated using six additional data curves. The model takes into account the effects of pH, Mg(2+), and Ca(2+) on ATP and P(i) transport via the APC, and supports the conclusion that the pH gradient across the IMM serves as the primary driving force for AdN uptake or efflux. Moreover, computer simulations demonstrate that extramatrix Ca(2+) modulates the turnover rate of the APC and not the binding affinity of ATP, as previously suggested.

abstract = {Calcium binding and signaling orchestrate a wide variety of essential cellular functions, many of which employ the EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif. The ion binding parameters of this motif are controlled, in part, by the structure of its Ca2+ binding loop, termed the EF-loop. The EF-loops of different proteins are carefully specialized, or fine-tuned, to yield optimized Ca2+ binding parameters for their unique cellular roles. The present study uses a structurally homologous Ca2+ binding loop, that of the Escherichia coli galactose binding protein, as a model for the EF-loop in studies examining the contribution of the third loop position to intramolecular tuning. 10 different side chains are compared at the third position of the model EF-loop with respect to their effects on protein stability, sugar binding, and metal binding equilibria and kinetics. Substitution of an acidic Asp side chain for the native Asn is found to generate a 6,000-fold increase in the ion selectivity for trivalent over divalent cations, providing strong support for the electrostatic repulsion model of divalent cation charge selectivity. Replacement of Asn by neutral side chains differing in size and shape each alter the ionic size selectivity in a similar manner, supporting a model in which large-ion size selectivity is controlled by complex interactions between multiple side chains rather than by the dimensions of a single coordinating side chain. Finally, the pattern of perturbations generated by side chain substitutions helps to explain the prevalence of Asn and Asp at the third position of natural EF-loops and provides further evidence supporting the unique kinetic tuning role of the gateway side chain at the ninth EF-loop position.},

abstract = {The S100A1 protein mediates a wide variety of physiological processes through its binding of calcium (Ca(2+)) and endogenous target proteins. S100A1 presents two Ca(2+)-binding domains: a high-affinity "canonical" EF (cEF) hand and a low-affinity "pseudo" EF (pEF) hand. Accumulating evidence suggests that both Ca(2+)-binding sites must be saturated to stabilize an open state conducive to peptide recognition, yet the pEF hand's low affinity limits Ca(2+) binding at normal physiological concentrations. To understand the molecular basis of Ca(2+) binding and open-state stabilization, we performed 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations of S100A1 in the apo/holo (Ca(2+)-free/bound) states and a half-saturated state, for which only the cEF sites are Ca(2+)-bound. Our simulations indicate that the pattern of oxygen coordination about Ca(2+) in the cEF relative to the pEF site contributes to the former's higher affinity, whereas Ca(2+) binding strongly reshapes the protein's conformational dynamics by disrupting $\beta$-sheet coupling between EF hands. Moreover, modeling of the half-saturated configuration suggests that the open state is unstable and reverts toward a closed state in the absence of the pEF Ca(2+) ion. These findings indicate that Ca(2+) binding at the cEF site alone is insufficient to stabilize opening; thus, posttranslational modification of the protein may be required for target peptide binding at subsaturating intracellular Ca(2+) levels.},

abstract = {Troponin C (TnC) is an EF-hand Ca2+ binding protein that regulates skeletal muscle contraction. The mechanisms that control the Ca2+ binding properties of TnC and other EF-hand proteins are not completely understood. We individually substituted 27 Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, and Met residues with polar Gln to examine the role of hydrophobic residues in Ca2+ binding and exchange with the N-domain of a fluorescent TnC(F29W). The global N-terminal Ca2+ affinities of the TnCF29W mutants varied similar to2340-fold, while Ca2+ association and dissociation rates varied less than 70-fold and more than 45-fold, respectively. Greater than 2-fold increases in Ca2+ affinities were obtained primarily by slowing of Ca2+ dissociation rates, while greater than 2-fold decreases in Ca2+ affinities were obtained by slowing of Ca2+ association rates and speeding of Ca2+ dissociation rates. No correlation was found between the Ca2+ binding properties of the TnC(F29W) mutants and the solvent accessibility of the hydrophobic amino acids in the apo state, Ca2+ bound state, or the difference between the two states. However, the effects of these hydrophobic mutations on Ca2+ binding were contextual possibly because of side chain interactions within the apo and Ca2+ bound states of the N-domain. These results demonstrate that a single hydrophobic residue, which does not directly ligate Ca2+ can play a crucial role in controlling Ca2+ binding and exchange within a coupled and functional EF-hand system.},

abstract = {The kinetics of contractions and Ca(2+) transients are slowed in myocytes from failing hearts. The mechanisms accounting for these abnormalities remain unclear. Myocardial infarction (MI) was produced by ligation of the circumflex artery in rabbits. We used confocal microscopy to record spatially resolved Ca(2+) transients during field stimulation in left ventricular (LV) myocytes from control and infarcted hearts (3 weeks). Compared with controls, Ca(2+) transients in myocytes adjacent to the infarct had lower peak amplitudes and prolonged time courses. Control myocytes showed relatively uniform changes in [Ca(2+)] throughout the cell after electrical stimulation. In contrast, in MI myocytes [Ca(2+)] increased inhomogeneously and localized increases in [Ca(2+)] occurred throughout the rising and falling phases of the Ca(2+) transient. Ca(2+) content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum did not differ between MI and control myocytes. Peak L-type Ca(2+) current density was reduced in MI myocytes. The macroscopic gain function was not different in control and MI myocytes when calculated as the amplitude of the Ca(2+) transient/peak I:(Ca). However, when calculated as the peak rate of rise of the Ca(2+) transient/peak I:(Ca), the gain function was modestly decreased in the MI myocytes. Application of isoproterenol (100 nmol/L) improved the synchronization of Ca(2+) release in MI myocytes at both 0.5 and 1 Hz. The poorly coordinated production of Ca(2+) sparks in myocytes from infarcted rabbit hearts likely contributes to the diminished and slowed macroscopic Ca(2+) transient. These abnormalities can be largely overcome when phosphorylation of Ca(2+) cycling proteins is enhanced by ss-adrenergic stimulation.},

abstract = {Ventricular dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients is becoming apparent early after diagnosis of diabetes, but the cellular mechanisms contributing to this dysfunction are not well established. Our group has recently identified cardiomyocyte dysfunction in diet-induced insulin resistant rats that have not developed type 2 diabetes. The present investigation was designed to determine cellular mechanisms contributing to slowed cardiomyocyte relaxation in sucrose (SU)-fed rats. SU-feeding was used to induce whole-body insulin resistance. After 9-12 weeks on diet, isolated ventricular myocyte shortening/relengthening were slower in SU-fed adult male Wistar rats (42-63{\%}) compared to starch (ST)-fed controls. Cytosolic Ca2+ removal attributable to Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX) and to sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) was evaluated with fluo-3/AM. Caffeine-releasable Ca2+ and cytosolic Ca2+ clearing through NCX were normal, whereas Ca2+ uptake by SERCA was significantly slower in SU myocytes (330+/-29 ms) compared to ST cells (253+/-16 ms). Protein levels for SERCA, NCX and phospholamban were not affected by SU-feeding. Manipulating intracellular Ca2+ with various positive inotropic interventions (e.g. post-rest potentiation, isoproterenol) and changes in stimulus frequency demonstrated that mechanical properties can be improved in subsets of myocytes. Thus, we conclude that impaired SERCA activity (with normal protein content) contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction in insulin resistant animals, whereas NCX function and expression are normal. These results suggest that subtle changes in Ca2+ regulation which occur prior to overt ventricular dysfunction/failure, may be common to early stages of a number of disorders involving insulin resistance (e.g. diabetes, obesity, syndrome X and hypertension).},

@article{Sarkar2010,
abstract = {A major challenge in computational biology is constraining free parameters in mathematical models. Adjusting a parameter to make a given model output more realistic sometimes has unexpected and undesirable effects on other model behaviors. Here, we extend a regression-based method for parameter sensitivity analysis and show that a straightforward procedure can uniquely define most ionic conductances in a well-known model of the human ventricular myocyte. The model's parameter sensitivity was analyzed by randomizing ionic conductances, running repeated simulations to measure physiological outputs, then collecting the randomized parameters and simulation results as "input" and "output" matrices, respectively. Multivariable regression derived a matrix whose elements indicate how changes in conductances influence model outputs. We show here that if the number of linearly-independent outputs equals the number of inputs, the regression matrix can be inverted. This is significant, because it implies that the inverted matrix can specify the ionic conductances that are required to generate a particular combination of model outputs. Applying this idea to the myocyte model tested, we found that most ionic conductances could be specified with precision (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.77 for 12 out of 16 parameters). We also applied this method to a test case of changes in electrophysiology caused by heart failure and found that changes in most parameters could be well predicted. We complemented our findings using a Bayesian approach to demonstrate that model parameters cannot be specified using limited outputs, but they can be successfully constrained if multiple outputs are considered. Our results place on a solid mathematical footing the intuition-based procedure simultaneously matching a model's output to several data sets. More generally, this method shows promise as a tool to define model parameters, in electrophysiology and in other biological fields.},

abstract = {We show that diffusion can play an important role in protein-folding kinetics. We explicitly calculate the diffusion coefficient of protein folding in a lattice model. We found that diffusion typically is configuration- or reaction coordinate-dependent. The diffusion coefficient is found to be decreasing with respect to the progression of folding toward the native state, which is caused by the collapse to a compact state constraining the configurational space for exploration. The configuration- or position-dependent diffusion coefficient has a significant contribution to the kinetics in addition to the thermodynamic free-energy barrier. It effectively changes (increases in this case) the kinetic barrier height as well as the position of the corresponding transition state and therefore modifies the folding kinetic rates as well as the kinetic routes. The resulting folding time, by considering both kinetic diffusion and the thermodynamic folding free-energy profile, thus is slower than the estimation from the thermodynamic free-energy barrier with constant diffusion but is consistent with the results from kinetic simulations. The configuration- or coordinate-dependent diffusion is especially important with respect to fast folding, when there is a small or no free-energy barrier and kinetics is controlled by diffusion. Including the configurational dependence will challenge the transition state theory of protein folding. The classical transition state theory will have to be modified to be consistent. The more detailed folding mechanistic studies involving phi value analysis based on the classical transition state theory also will have to be modified quantitatively.},

abstract = {The cardiac SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) regulates intracellular Ca(2+)-handling and thus, plays a crucial role in initiating cardiac contraction and relaxation. SERCA2a may be modulated through its accessory phosphoprotein phospholamban or by direct phosphorylation through Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II). As an inhibitory component phospholamban, in its dephosphorylated form, inhibits the Ca(2+)-dependent SERCA2a function, while protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation of the phospho-residues serine-16 or Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of threonine-17 relieves this inhibition. Recent evidence suggests that direct phosphorylation at residue serine-38 in SERCA2a activates enzyme function and enhances Ca(2+)-reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These effects that are mediated through phosphorylation result in an overall increased SR Ca(2+)-load and enhanced contractility. In human heart failure patients, as well as animal models with induced heart failure, these modulations are altered and may result in an attenuated SR Ca(2+)-storage and modulated contractility. It is also believed that abnormalities in Ca(2+)-cycling are responsible for blunting the frequency potentiation of contractile force in the failing human heart. Advanced gene expression and modulatory approaches have focused on enhancing SERCA2a function via overexpressing SERCA2a under physiological and pathophysiological conditions to restore cardiac function, cardiac energetics and survival rate.},

The results have implications for the role of this protein in myocardial contraction, with particular relevance to $\beta$-adrenergic signaling, heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. N-terminal cMyBP-C domains C0-C2 (C0C2) contain binding regions for potential interactions with both thick and thin filaments. Phosphorylation by PKA in the MyBP-C motif regulates these binding interactions. Our spectroscopic assays detect distances between pairs of site-directed probes on cMyBP-C. We engineered intramolecular pairs of labeling sites within cMyBP-C to measure, with high resolution, the distance and disorder in the protein's flexible regions using TR-FRET and DEER. Phosphorylation reduced the level of molecular disorder and the distribution of C0C2 intramolecular distances became more compact, with probes flanking either the motif between C1 and C2 or the Pro/Ala-rich linker (PAL) between C0 and C1. Further insight was obtained from microsecond MD simulations, which revealed a large structural change in the disordered motif region in which phosphorylation unmasks the surface of a series of residues on a stable $\alpha$-helix within the motif with high potential as a protein-protein interaction site. These experimental and computational findings elucidate structural transitions in the flexible and dynamic portions of cMyBP-C, providing previously unidentified molecular insight into the modulatory role of this protein in cardiac muscle contractility.},

The prediction that the transition state should bind to the enzyme much more tightly than the substrate is supported by the experimental results with stable analogs of transition states. Transition-state analogs have great potential for use in understanding enzymatic catalysis and in inhibiting enzymes. Because of their potency and specificity as enzyme inhibitors, some of them may become very useful chemotherapeutic agents.},

abstract = {The sarcomere force-length relationship is arguably the most basic property of skeletal muscle force production. It has been accepted as textbook knowledge and is in direct support of the sliding filament and cross-bridge theories of contraction. However, the sarcomere force-length relationship has never been measured directly. Here, we show results of two experiments elucidating the force-length properties of mechanically isolated sarcomeres. We demonstrate that sarcomere forces are greatly dependent on sarcomere lengths for purely isometric conditions, but can take on essentially any steady-state value depending on an individual sarcomere's contractile history. Therefore, we conclude that steady-state isometric forces in isolated sarcomeres do not only depend on sarcomere lengths (or equivalently actin-myosin overlap) but depend crucially on a sarcomere's contractile history. These results have direct implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction.},

Here we demonstrate a rational method for enhancing the stability of globular proteins by targeting glycine residues which adopt conformations with Phi {\textgreater} 0. Replacement of such a glycine by d-alanine can lead to a significant increase in stability. The approach is tested at three sites in two model proteins. NMR and CD indicated that the substitutions do not alter the structure. Replacement of glycine-24 of the N-terminal domain of L9 (NTL9) with d-Ala results in an increase in stability of 1.3 kcal mol-1, while replacement of glycine-34 of NTL9 leads to an increase of 1.9 kcal mol-1. Replacement of glycine-331 of the UBA domain with d-Ala leads to an increase in stability of 0.6 kcal mol-1.},

The Fast Atomic Density Evaluation (FADE) algorithm uses fast Fourier transforms to quickly estimate densities. The Pairwise Atomic Density Reverse Engineering (PADRE) method derives modified density measures from the relationship between atomic density and total potentials. While many shape-characterization techniques define shape relative to a surface, the descriptors returned by FADE and PADRE can measure local geometry from points within the three-dimensional space surrounding a molecule. The methods can be used to find crevices and protrusions near the surface of a molecule and to test shape complementarity at the interface between docking molecules.},

abstract = {Recent results from x-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics free-energy simulations have revealed the existence of a number of specific cation-binding sites disposed along the narrow pore of the K+ channel from Streptomyces lividans (KcsA), suggesting that K+ ions might literally "hop" in single file from one binding site to the next as permeation proceeds. In support of this view, it was found that the ion configurations correspond to energy wells of similar depth and that ion translocation is opposed only by small energy barriers. Although such features of the multiion potential energy surface are certainly essential for achieving a high throughput rate, diffusional and dissipative dynamical factors must also be taken into consideration to understand how rapid conduction of K+ is possible. To elucidate the mechanism of ion conduction, we established a framework theory enabling the direct simulation of nonequilibrium fluxes by extending the results of molecular dynamics over macroscopically long times. In good accord with experimental measurements, the simulated maximum conductance of the channel at saturating concentration is on the order of 550 and 360 pS for outward and inward ions flux, respectively, with a unidirectional flux-ratio exponent of 3. Analysis of the ion-conduction process reveals a lack of equivalence between the cation-binding sites in the selectivity filter.},

abstract = {Phospholamban is an integral membrane protein that controls the calcium balance in cardiac muscle cells. As the function and regulation of this protein require the active involvement of low populated states in equilibrium with the native state, it is of great interest to acquire structural information about them. In this work, we calculate the conformations and populations of the ground state and the three main excited states of phospholamban by incorporating nuclear magnetic resonance residual dipolar couplings as replica-averaged structural restraints in molecular dynamics simulations. We then provide a description of the manner in which phosphorylation at Ser16 modulates the activity of the protein by increasing the sizes of the populations of its excited states. These results demonstrate that the approach that we describe provides a detailed characterization of the different states of phospholamban that determine the function and regulation of this membrane protein. We anticipate that the knowledge of conformational ensembles enable the design of new dominant negative mutants of phospholamban by modulating the relative populations of its conformational substates.},

The meanings of the rearrangements of the transmembrane helices and those of the cytoplasmic domains as well as the mechanistic roles of phosphorylation are now becoming clear. Furthermore, the roles of critical amino acid residues identified by extensive mutagenesis studies are becoming evident in terms of atomic structure.},

@article{Tanner2007,
abstract = {In muscle, force emerges from myosin binding with actin ( forming a cross-bridge). This actomyosin binding depends upon myofilament geometry, kinetics of thin-filament Ca2+ activation, and kinetics of cross-bridge cycling. Binding occurs within a compliant network of protein filaments where there is mechanical coupling between myosins along the thick-filament backbone and between actin monomers along the thin filament. Such mechanical coupling precludes using ordinary differential equation models when examining the effects of lattice geometry, kinetics, or compliance on force production. This study uses two stochastically driven, spatially explicit models to predict levels of cross-bridge binding, force, thin-filament Ca2+ activation, and ATP utilization. One model incorporates the 2-to-1 ratio of thin to thick filaments of vertebrate striated muscle (multi-filament model), while the other comprises only one thick and one thin filament (two-filament model). Simulations comparing these models show that the multi-filament predictions of force, fractional cross-bridge binding, and cross-bridge turnover are more consistent with published experimental values. Furthermore, the values predicted by the multi-filament model are greater than those values predicted by the two-filament model. These increases are larger than the relative increase of potential inter-filament interactions in the multi-filament model versus the two-filament model. This amplification of coordinated cross-bridge binding and cycling indicates a mechanism of cooperativity that depends on sarcomere lattice geometry, specifically the ratio and arrangement of myofilaments.},

abstract = {A previously developed hybrid particle-continuum method [J. B. Bell, A. Garcia, and S. A. Williams, Multiscale Model. Simul., 6 (2008), pp. 1256-1280] is generalized to dense fluids and two-and three-dimensional flows. The scheme couples an explicit fluctuating compressible Navier Stokes solver with the isotropic direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) particle method [A. Donev, A. L. Garcia, and B. J. Alder, J. Stat. Mech. Theory Exp., 2009 (2009), article P11008]. To achieve bidirectional dynamic coupling between the particle (microscale) and continuum (macroscale) regions, the continuum solver provides state-based boundary conditions to the particle subdomain, while the particle solver provides flux-based boundary conditions for the continuum subdomain. This type of coupling ensures both state and flux continuity across the particle-continuum interface analogous to coupling approaches for deterministic parabolic partial differential equations; here, when fluctuations are included, a small ({\textless} 1{\%}) mismatch is expected and observed in the mean density and temperature across the interface. By calculating the dynamic structure factor for both a "bulk" (periodic) and a finite system, it is verified that the hybrid algorithm accurately captures the propagation of spontaneous thermal fluctuations across the particle-continuum interface. The equilibrium diffusive (Brownian) motion of a large spherical bead suspended in a particle fluid is examined, demonstrating that the hybrid method correctly reproduces the velocity autocorrelation function of the bead but only if thermal fluctuations are included in the continuum solver. Finally, the hybrid is applied to the well-known adiabatic piston problem, and it is found that the hybrid correctly reproduces the slow nonequilibrium relaxation of the piston toward thermodynamic equilibrium but, again, only if the continuum solver includes stochastic (white-noise) flux terms. These examples clearly demonstrate the need to include fluctuations in continuum solvers employed in hybrid multiscale methods.},

Often, conformational switching occurs on time scales of several seconds. In combination with the recent real-time NMR experiments (Wenter et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005, 44, 2600; Wenter et al. ChemBioChem 2006, 7, 417) for the transitions between bistable RNA conformations, we combine the master equation method with the kinetic cluster method to investigate the detailed kinetic mechanism and the factors that govern the folding kinetics. We propose that heat capacity change ($\Delta$C(p)) upon RNA folding may be important for RNA folding kinetics. In addition, we find that, for tetraloop hairpins, noncanonical (tertiary) intraloop interactions are important to determine the folding kinetics. Furthermore, through theory-experiment comparisons, we find that the different rate models for the fundamental steps (i.e., formation/disruption of a base pair or stack) can cause contrasting results in the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {A particle-based mesoscopic model for enzyme kinetics is constructed and used to investigate the influence of diffusion on the reactive dynamics. Enzymes and enzyme-substrate complexes are modeled as finite-size soft spherical particles, while substrate, product, and solvent molecules are point particles. The system is evolved using a hybrid molecular dynamics-multiparticle collision dynamics scheme. Both the nonreactive and reactive dynamics are constructed to satisfy mass, momentum, and energy conservation laws, and reversible reaction steps satisfy detailed balance. Hydrodynamic interactions among the enzymes and complexes are automatically accounted for in the dynamics. Diffusion manifests itself in various ways, notably in power-law behavior in the evolution of the species concentrations. In accord with earlier investigations, regimes where the product production rate exhibits either monotonic or nonmonotonic behavior as a function of time are found. In addition, the species concentrations display both t(-1/2) and t(-3/2) power-law behavior, depending on the dynamical regime under investigation. For high enzyme volume fractions, cooperative effects influence the enzyme kinetics. The time dependent rate coefficient determined from the mass action rate law is computed and shown to depend on the enzyme concentration. Lifetime distributions of substrate molecules newly released in complex dissociation events are determined and shown to have either a power-law form for rebinding to the same enzyme from which they were released or an exponential form for rebinding to different enzymes. The model can be used and extended to explore a variety of issues related concentration effects and diffusion on enzyme kinetics.},

abstract = {We have developed a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ handling and ionic currents in the rabbit ventricular myocyte. The objective was to develop a model that: 1), accurately reflects Ca-dependent Ca release; 2), uses realistic parameters, particularly those that concern Ca transport from the cytosol; 3), comes to steady state; 4), simulates basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; and 5), runs on a normal desktop computer. The model includes the following novel features: 1), the addition of a subsarcolemmal compartment to the other two commonly formulated cytosolic compartments (junctional and bulk) because ion channels in the membrane sense ion concentrations that differ from bulk; 2), the use of realistic cytosolic Ca buffering parameters; 3), a reversible sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca pump; 4), a scheme for Na-Ca exchange transport that is [Na](i) dependent and allosterically regulated by [Ca](i); and 5), a practical model of SR Ca release including both inactivation/adaptation and SR Ca load dependence. The data describe normal electrical activity and Ca handling characteristics of the cardiac myocyte and the SR Ca load dependence of these processes. The model includes a realistic balance of Ca removal mechanisms (e.g., SR Ca pump versus Na-Ca exchange), and the phenomena of rest decay and frequency-dependent inotropy. A particular emphasis is placed upon reproducing the nonlinear dependence of gain and fractional SR Ca release upon SR Ca load. We conclude that this model is more robust than many previously existing models and reproduces many experimental results using parameters based largely on experimental measurements in myocytes.},

abstract = {Mathematical modeling of Ca(2+) dynamics in the heart has the potential to provide an integrated understanding of Ca(2+)-handling mechanisms. However, many previous published models used heterogeneous experimental data sources from a variety of animals and temperatures to characterize model parameters and motivate model equations. This methodology limits the direct comparison of these models with any particular experimental data set. To directly address this issue, in this study, we present a biophysically based model of Ca(2+) dynamics directly fitted to experimental data collected in left ventricular myocytes isolated from the C57BL/6 mouse, the most commonly used genetic background for genetically modified mice in studies of heart diseases. This Ca(2+) dynamics model was then integrated into an existing mouse cardiac electrophysiology model, which was reparameterized using experimental data recorded at consistent and physiological temperatures. The model was validated against the experimentally observed frequency response of Ca(2+) dynamics, action potential shape, dependence of action potential duration on cycle length, and electrical restitution. Using this framework, the implications of cardiac Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) overexpression in transgenic mice were investigated. These simulations showed that heterozygous overexpression of the canine cardiac NCX increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentration transient magnitude and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) loading, in agreement with experimental observations, whereas acute overexpression of the murine cardiac NCX results in a significant loss of Ca(2+) from the cell and, hence, depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration transient magnitude. From this analysis, we conclude that these differences are primarily due to the presence of allosteric regulation in the canine cardiac NCX, which has not been observed experimentally in the wild-type mouse heart.},

abstract = {Ca(2+) signaling regulates cell function. This is subject to modulation by H(+) ions that are universal end-products of metabolism. Due to slow diffusion and common buffers, changes in cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)]i) or [H(+)] ([H(+)]i) can become compartmentalized, leading potentially to complex spatial Ca(2+)/H(+) coupling. This was studied by fluorescence imaging of cardiac myocytes. An increase in [H(+)]i, produced by superfusion of acetate (salt of membrane-permeant weak acid), evoked a [Ca(2+)]i rise, independent of sarcolemmal Ca(2+) influx or release from mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum, or acidic stores. Photolytic H(+) uncaging from 2-nitrobenzaldehyde also raised [Ca(2+)]i, and the yield was reduced following inhibition of glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration. H(+) uncaging into buffer mixtures in vitro demonstrated that Ca(2+) unloading from proteins, histidyl dipeptides (HDPs; e.g., carnosine), and ATP can underlie the H(+)-evoked [Ca(2+)]i rise. Raising [H(+)]i tonically at one end of a myocyte evoked a local [Ca(2+)]i rise in the acidic microdomain, which did not dissipate. The result is consistent with uphill Ca(2+) transport into the acidic zone via Ca(2+)/H(+) exchange on diffusible HDPs and ATP molecules, energized by the [H(+)]i gradient. Ca(2+) recruitment to a localized acid microdomain was greatly reduced during intracellular Mg(2+) overload or by ATP depletion, maneuvers that reduce the Ca(2+)-carrying capacity of HDPs. Cytoplasmic HDPs and ATP underlie spatial Ca(2+)/H(+) coupling in the cardiac myocyte by providing ion exchange and transport on common buffer sites. Given the abundance of cellular HDPs and ATP, spatial Ca(2+)/H(+) coupling is likely to be of general importance in cell signaling.},

abstract = {Calcium binding to troponin C and troponin was examined by a metallochromic indicator method under various conditions to obtain a further understanding of the regulatory roles of these proteins in muscle contraction. Troponin C has four Ca binding sites, of which 2 sites have a high affinity of 4.5 X 10(6) M-1 for Ca2+ and the other 2 sites have a low affinity of 6.4 X 10(4) M-1 in a reaction medium consisting of 100 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS-KOH pH 6.80 and 0.13 mM tetramethylmurexide at 20 degrees C. Magnesium also binds competitively to both the high and low affinity sites: the apparent binding constants are 1,000 M-1 and 520 M-1, respectively. Contrary to the claim by Potter and Gergely (J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4628-4633, 1975), the low affinity sites are not specific only for Ca2+. The high and low affinity sites of troponin C showed different dependence on the ionic strength: the high affinity sites were similar to GEDTA, while the low affinity sites were similar to calmodulin, which has a steeper ionic strength dependence than GEDTA. Ca binding to troponin C was not affected by change of pH between 6.5 and 7.2. Troponin I enhanced the apparent affinity of troponin C for Ca2+ to a value similar to that for troponin. Trifluoperazine also increased Ca binding to troponin C. Troponin has four Ca binding sites as does troponin C, but the affinities are so high that the precise analysis was difficult by this method. The apparent binding constants for Ca2+ and Mg2+ were determined to be 3.5 X 10(6) M-1 and 440 M-1, respectively, for low affinity sites under the same conditions as for troponin C, being independent of change in pH between 6.5 and 7.2. The competitive binding of Mg2+ to the low affinity sites of troponin is consistent with the results of Kohama (J. Biochem. 88, 591-599, 1980). The estimate for the high affinity sites is compatible with the reported results.},

abstract = {Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is an inherited disorder affecting roughly one in 500 people. Its hallmark is abnormal thickening of the ventricular wall, leading to serious complications that include heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Treatment is complicated by variation in the severity, symptoms and risks for sudden death within the patient population. Nearly all of the genetic lesions associated with FHC occur in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, indicating that defects in cardiac muscle contraction underlie the condition. Detailed biophysical data are increasingly available for computational analyses that could be used to predict heart phenotypes based on genotype. These models must integrate the dynamic processes occurring in cardiac cells with properties of myocardial tissue, heart geometry and haemodynamic load in order to predict strain and stress in the ventricular walls and overall pump function. Recent advances have increased the biophysical detail in these models at the myofilament level, which will allow properties of FHC-linked mutant proteins to be accurately represented in simulations of whole heart function. The short-term impact of these models will be detailed descriptions of contractile dysfunction and altered myocardial strain patterns at the earliest stages of the disease-predictions that could be validated in genetically modified animals. Long term, these multi-scale models have the potential to improve clinical management of FHC through genotype-based risk stratification and personalized therapy.},

abstract = {Ca2+ signaling in cells is largely governed by Ca2+ diffusion and Ca2+ binding to mobile and stationary Ca2+ buffers, including organelles. To examine Ca2+ signaling in cardiac atrial myocytes, a mathematical model of Ca2+ diffusion was developed which represents several subcellular compartments, including a subsarcolemmal space with restricted diffusion, a myofilament space, and the cytosol. The model was used to quantitatively simulate experimental Ca2+ signals in terms of amplitude, time course, and spatial features. For experimental reference data, L-type Ca2+ currents were recorded from atrial cells with the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Ca2+ signals were simultaneously imaged with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo-3 and a laser-scanning confocal microscope. The simulations indicate that in atrial myocytes lacking T-tubules, Ca2+ movement from the cell membrane to the center of the cells relies strongly on the presence of mobile Ca2+ buffers, particularly when the sarcoplasmic reticulum is inhibited pharmacologically. Furthermore, during the influx of Ca2+ large and steep concentration gradients are predicted between the cytosol and the submicroscopically narrow subsarcolemmal space. In addition, the computations revealed that, despite its low Ca2+ affinity, ATP acts as a significant buffer and carrier for Ca2+, even at the modest elevations of [Ca2+](i) reached during influx of Ca2+.},

A computationally more feasible alternative is a generalized Born implicit solvent description which models polar solvent as a dielectric continuum.

Longer cutoff distances, spatially heterogeneous distribution of atoms, and the necessary 3-fold iteration over atom pairs in each timestep combine to challenge efficient parallel performance of generalized Born implicit solvent algorithms. Here, we report how NAMD, a parallel molecular dynamics program, meets the challenge through a unique parallelization strategy.

We will also describe some of our approaches to rationally design calcium binding proteins to palliate, or potentially even cure cardiovascular disease.

abstract = {The conformational change in the unphosphorylated sodium pump was studied as a function of ionic strength to learn whether the rate of the reaction is affected. The results corroborate our proposal [Smirnova, I. N., Lin, S.-H., and Faller, L. D. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 8657-8667] that competitive binding of the transported ions to two (or more) equivalent sites regulates a concerted change in protein conformation. An approximately 10-fold increase in ionic strength decreased the intrinsic affinity of the Na+ conformation of the enzyme for both Na+ and K+ roughly 3-fold, decreased the rate of the change from Na+ to K+ conformation by more than half, and increased the rate of the reverse reaction by about an order of magnitude. The logarithm of the first-order rate constant for the change from Na+ to K+ conformation depended inversely upon the square root of the ionic strength with the extrapolated value at zero ionic strength expressed as a second-order rate constant (1.1 x 10(9) M(-1) sec(-1)) approaching the limit for a diffusion-controlled reaction. The first-order rate constant for the change from K+ to Na+ conformation depended directly upon ionic strength and extrapolated to a zero-ionic-strength value (0.002 s(-1)) far below the diffusion limit. The results are compatible with shielding of oppositely charged domains that move through the solvent when the pump cycles between conformations. Electrostatic interactions between domains evidently contribute to the driving force for the change from Na+ to K+ conformation and to the stability of the K+ conformation.},

challenges related to the size of the physical platform, photon efficiency, the

This paper describes a coded aperture and keyed exposure approach to
compressive measurement in optical systems. The proposed projections satisfy
the Restricted Isometry Property for sufficiently sparse scenes, and hence are
compatible with theoretical guarantees on the video reconstruction quality.
These concepts can be implemented in both space and time via either amplitude
modulation or phase shifting, and this paper describes the relative merits of
the two approaches in terms of theoretical performance, noise and hardware
considerations, and experimental results. Fast numerical algorithms which
account for the nonnegativity of the projections and temporal correlations in a
video sequence are developed and applied to microscopy and short-wave infrared

abstract = {Electrically charged long-chain macromolecules in an electrolyte can form an ordered lattice whose spacing is greater than their diameter. If entropic effects are neglected, these nematic structures can be predicted from a balance of Coulomb repulsion and van-der-Waals attraction forces. To enhance the utility of such theories, this paper extends existing results for the interaction between charged filaments, and gives approximate formulae for the screened Coulomb and van-der-Waals potentials over the whole range of their centre-to-centre spacing d. The repulsive Coulomb potential is proportional to exp(-$\lambda$d)/$\lambda$d for all spacings when the Debye screening length 1/$\lambda$ is smaller than the sum of the filament radii. The attractive van-der-Waals potential is asymptotic to d⁻⁵ at large d. For smaller spacings, the potential is calculated by numerical integration and compared with published formulae: the series expansion of Brenner and McQuarrie converges too slowly, whereas the interpolation formula of Moisescu provides reasonable accuracy over the whole range of d. Combining these potentials shows that there is a finite range of charge densities for which a nematic crystal lattice is stable, but this conclusion ignores entropic effects associated with motile filaments. The role of electrostatic forces in aligning filaments and stabilizing a nematic liquid-crystal phase is discussed, in conjunction with other mechanisms such as motor proteins, crosslinkers or scaffolding structures.},

abstract = {Accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) has been shown to enhance conformational space sampling relative to classical molecular dynamics; however, the exponential reweighting of aMD trajectories, which is necessary for the calculation of free energies relating to the classical system, is oftentimes problematic, especially for systems larger than small poly peptides. Here, we propose a method of accelerating only the degrees of freedom most pertinent to sampling, thereby reducing the total acceleration added to the system and improving the convergence of calculated ensemble averages, which we term selective aMD. Its application is highlighted in two biomolecular cases. First, the model system alanine dipeptide is simulated with classical MD, all-dihedral aMD, and selective aMD, and these results are compared to the infinite sampling limit as calculated with metadynamics. We show that both forms of aMD enhance the convergence of the underlying free energy landscape by 5-fold relative to classical MD; however, selective aMD can produce improved statistics over all-dihedral aMD due to the improved reweighting. Then we focus on the pharmaceutically relevant case of computing the free energy of the decoupling of oseltamivir in the active site of neuraminidase. Results show that selective aMD greatly reduces the cost of this alchemical free energy transformation, whereas all-dihedral aMD produces unreliable free energy estimates.},

However, the improvement is rather limited, and for 93{\%} of the dihedrals that have alternative conformations in the crystal structures, the conformational space is well sampled even if a single conformation is used as the starting structure.

abstract = {We discuss the general energetic variational approaches for hydrodynamic systems of complex fluids. In these energetic variational approaches, the least action principle (LAP) with action functional gives the Hamiltonian parts (conservative force) of the hydrodynamic systems, and the maximum/minimum dissipation principle (MDP), i.e., Onsager's principle, gives the dissipative parts (dissipative force) of the systems. When we combine the two systems derived from the two different principles, we obtain a whole coupled nonlinear system of equations satisfying the dissipative energy law. We will discuss the important roles of MDP in designing numerical method for computations of hydrodynamic systems in complex fluids. We will reformulate the dissipation in energy equation interms of a rate in time by using an appropriate evolution equations, then the MDP is employed in the reformulated dissipation to obtain the dissipative force for the hydrodynamic systems. The systems are consistent with the Hamiltonian parts which are derived from LAP. This procedure allows the usage of lower order element (a continuous C-0 finite element) in numerical method to solve the system rather than high order elements, and at the same time preserves the dissipative energy law. We also verify this method through some numerical experiments in simulating the free interface motion in the mixture of two different fluids.},

abstract = {Since their first synthesis in the 1940s, zeolites have found wide applications in catalysis, ion-exchange, and adsorption. Although the uniform, molecular-size pores of zeolites and their excellent thermal and chemical stability suggest that zeolites could be an ideal membrane material, continuous polycrystalline zeolite layers for separations were first prepared in the 1990s. Initial attempts to grow continuous zeolite layers on porous supports by in situ hydrothermal synthesis have resulted in membranes with the potential to separate molecules based on differences in molecular size and adsorption strength. Since then, further synthesis efforts have led to the preparation of many types of zeolite membranes and better quality membranes. However, the microstructure features of these membranes, such as defect size, number, and distribution as well as structure flexibility were poorly understood, and the fundamental mechanisms of permeation (adsorption and diffusion), especially for mixtures, were not clear. These gaps in understanding have hindered the design and control of separation processes using zeolite membranes.  In this Account, we describe our efforts to characterize microstructures of zeolite membranes and to understand the fundamental adsorption and diffusion behavior of permeating solutes. This Account will focus on the MFI membranes which have been the most widely used but will also present results on other types of zeolite membranes.  Using permeation, x-ray diffraction, and optical measurements, we found that the zeolite membrane structures are flexible. The size of defects changed due to adsorption and with variations in temperature. These changes in defect sizes can significantly affect the permeation properties of the membranes. We designed methods to measure mixture adsorption in zeolite crystals from the liquid phase, pure component adsorption in zeolite membranes, and diffusion through zeolite membranes. We hope that better understanding can lead to improved zeolite membranes and eventually facilitate the large-scale application of zeolite membranes to industrial separations.},

abstract = {Microprocessor-controlled changes of [free Ca2+] at the outer surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) wrapped around individual myofibrils of a skinned canine cardiac Purkinje cell and aequorin bioluminescence recording were used to study the mechanism of Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ from the SR. This Ca2+ release is triggered by a rapid increase of [free Ca2+] at the outer surface of the SR of a previously quiescent skinned cell. Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ occurred under conditions that prevented any synthesis of ATP from ADP, was affected differentially by interventions that depressed the SR Ca2+ pump about equally, and required ionic conditions incompatible with all known Ca2+-releasing, uncoupled, partial reactions of the Ca2+ pump. Increasing the [free Ca2+]trigger up to an optimum increased the amount of Ca2+ released. A supraoptimum increase of [free Ca2+] trigger inactivated Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+, but partial inactivation was also observed at [free Ca2+] below that necessary for its activation. The amplitude of the Ca2+ release induced by a given increase of [free Ca2+] decreased when the rate of this increase was diminished. These results suggest that Ca2+-induced release of Ca2+ is through a channel across the SR membrane with time- and Ca2+-dependent activation and inactivation. The inactivating binding site would have a higher affinity for Ca2+ but a lower rate constant than the activating site. Inactivation appeared to be a first-order kinetic reaction of Ca2+ binding to a single site at the outer face of the SR with a Q10 of 1.68. The removal of inactivation was the slowest step of the cycle, responsible for a highly temperature-dependent (Q10 approximately 4.00) refractory period.},

abstract = {The transverse tubular system of rabbit ventricular myocytes consists of cell membrane invaginations (t-tubules) that are essential for efficient cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. In this study, we investigate how t-tubule micro-anatomy, L-type Ca(2+) channel (LCC) clustering, and allosteric activation of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger by L-type Ca(2+) current affects intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. Our model includes a realistic 3D geometry of a single t-tubule and its surrounding half-sarcomeres for rabbit ventricular myocytes. The effects of spatially distributed membrane ion-transporters (LCC, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, sarcolemmal Ca(2+) pump, and sarcolemmal Ca(2+) leak), and stationary and mobile Ca(2+) buffers (troponin C, ATP, calmodulin, and Fluo-3) are also considered. We used a coupled reaction-diffusion system to describe the spatio-temporal concentration profiles of free and buffered intracellular Ca(2+). We obtained parameters from voltage-clamp protocols of L-type Ca(2+) current and line-scan recordings of Ca(2+) concentration profiles in rabbit cells, in which the sarcoplasmic reticulum is disabled. Our model results agree with experimental measurements of global Ca(2+) transient in myocytes loaded with 50 $\mu$M Fluo-3. We found that local Ca(2+) concentrations within the cytosol and sub-sarcolemma, as well as the local trigger fluxes of Ca(2+) crossing the cell membrane, are sensitive to details of t-tubule micro-structure and membrane Ca(2+) flux distribution. The model additionally predicts that local Ca(2+) trigger fluxes are at least threefold to eightfold higher than the whole-cell Ca(2+) trigger flux. We found also that the activation of allosteric Ca(2+)-binding sites on the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger could provide a mechanism for regulating global and local Ca(2+) trigger fluxes in vivo. Our studies indicate that improved structural and functional models could improve our understanding of the contributions of L-type and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger fluxes to intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics.},

abstract = {The quantitative analysis of the contribution of ion fluxes through membrane channels to changes of intracellular ion concentrations would benefit from the exact knowledge of the cell volume. It would allow direct correlation of ionic current measurements with simultaneous measurements of ion concentrations in individual cells. Because of various limitations of conventional light microscopy a simple method for accurate cell volume determination is lacking. We have combined the optical sectioning capabilities of fluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to study the correlation between cell volume and membrane capacitance. Single cardiac myocytes loaded with the fluorescent dye calcein were optically sectioned to produce a series of confocal images. The volume of cardiac myocytes of three different mammalian species was determined by three-dimensional volume rendering of the confocal images. The calculated cell volumes were 30.4 +/- 7.3 pl (mean +/- SD) in rabbits (n = 28), 30.9 +/- 9.0 pl in ferrets (n = 23), and 34.4 +/- 7.0 pl in rats (n = 21), respectively. There was a positive linear correlation between membrane capacitance and cell volume in each animal species. The capacitance-volume ratios were significantly different among species (4.58 +/- 0.45 pF/pl in rabbit, 5.39 +/- 0.57 pF/pl in ferret, and 8.44 +/- 1.35 pF/pl in rat). Furthermore, the capacitance-volume ratio was dependent on the developmental stage (8.88 +/- 1.14 pF/pl in 6-month-old rats versus 6.76 +/- 0.62 pF/pl in 3-month-old rats). The data suggest that the ratio of surface area:volume of cardiac myocytes undergoes significant developmental changes and differs among mammalian species. We further established that the easily measurable parameters of cell membrane capacitance or the product of cell length and width provide reliable but species-dependent estimates for the volume of individual cells.},

We first introduce an appropriate energy term into the total energy that represents the hard sphere repulsion of ions. The total energy then consists of the entropic energy, electrostatic potential energy, and the repulsive potential energy. The energetic variational approach derives a boundary value problem that includes contributions from the repulsive term with a no flux boundary condition for charge density which is a consequence of the variational approach, and physically implies charge conservation. The resulting system of partial differential equations is a modification of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations widely if not universally used to describe the drift-diffusion of electrons and holes in semiconductors, and the movement of ions in solutions and protein channels. The modified PNP equations include the effects of the finite size of ions that are so important in the concentrated solutions near electrodes, active sites of enzymes, and selectivity filters of proteins. Finally, we do some numerical experiments using finite element methods, and present their results as a verification of the utility of the modified system.},

@article{Dunlap2013,
abstract = {Calcineurin (CaN) is a calmodulin-activated, serine/threonine phosphatase that is necessary for cardiac, vasculature, and nervous system development, as well as learning and memory, skeletal muscle growth, and immune system activation. CaN is activated in a manner similar to that of the calmodulin (CaM)-activated kinases. CaM binds CaN's regulatory domain (RD) and causes a conformational change that removes CaN's autoinhibitory domain (AID) from its catalytic site, activating CaN. In the CaM-activated kinases, the CaM binding region (CaMBR) is located just C-terminal to the AID, whereas in CaN, the AID is 52 residues C-terminal to the CaMBR. Previously published data have shown that these 52 residues in CaN's RD are disordered but approximately half of them gain structure, likely $\alpha$-helical, upon CaM binding. In this work, we confirm that this increase in the level of structure is $\alpha$-helical. We posit that this region forms an amphipathic helix upon CaM binding and folds onto the remainder of the RD:CaM complex, removing the AID. F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer data suggest the C-terminal end of this distal helix is relatively close to the N-terminal end of the CaMBR when the RD is bound by CaM. We show by circular dichroism spectroscopy and thermal melts that mutations on the hydrophobic face of the distal helix disrupt the structure gained upon CaM binding. Additionally, kinetic analysis of CaN activity suggests that these mutations affect CaN's ability to bind substrate, likely a result of the AID being able to bind to the active site even when CaM is bound. Our data demonstrate the presence of this distal helix and suggest it folds onto the remainder of the RD:CaM complex, creating a hairpinlike chain reversal that removes the AID from the active site.},

@article{Choi2002,
abstract = {The goal of the study was to determine whether defects in intracellular Ca2+ signaling contribute to cardiomyopathy in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. Depression in cardiac systolic and diastolic function was traced from live diabetic rats to isolated individual myocytes. The depression in contraction and relaxation in myocytes was found in parallel with depression in the rise and decline of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)). The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ store and rates of Ca2+ release and resequestration into SR were depressed in diabetic rat myocytes. The rate of Ca2+ efflux via sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was also depressed. However, there was no change in the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel current that triggers Ca2+ release from the SR. The depression in SR function was associated with decreased SR Ca2+-ATPase and ryanodine receptor proteins and increased total and nonphosphorylated phospholamban proteins. The depression of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity was associated with a decrease in its protein level. Thus it is concluded that defects in intracellular Ca2+ signaling caused by alteration of expression and function of the proteins that regulate [Ca2+](i) contribute to cardiomyopathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The increase in phospholamban, decrease in Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and unchanged L-type Ca2+ channel activity in this model of diabetic cardiomyopathy are distinct from other types of cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutations were produced in the distal segments of the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) transmembrane region. Mutations of Arg-290 (M3-M4 loop), Lys-958, and Thr-960 (M9-M10 loop) had minor effects on ATPase activity and Ca2+ transport. On the other hand, Val-304 (M4) mutations to Ile, Thr, Lys, Ala, or Glu inhibited transport by 90-95{\%} while reducing ATP hydrolysis by 83{\%} (Ile, Thr, and Lys), 56{\%} (Ala), or 45{\%} (Glu). Val-304 participates in Ca2+ coordination with its main-chain carbonyl oxygen, and this function is not expected to be altered by mutations of its side chain. In fact, despite turnover inhibition, the Ca2+ concentration dependence of residual ATPase activity remained unchanged in Val-304 mutants. However, the rates (but not the final levels) of phosphoenzyme formation, as well the rates of its hydrolytic cleavage, were reduced in proportion to the ATPase activity. Furthermore, with the Val-304 -{\textgreater} Glu mutant, which retained the highest residual ATPase activity, it was possible to show that occlusion of bound Ca2+ was also impaired, thereby explaining the stronger inhibition of Ca2+ transport relative to ATPase activity. The effects of Val-304 mutations on phosphoenzyme turnover are attributed to interference with mechanical links that couple movements of transmembrane segments and headpiece domains. The effects of thermal activation energy on reaction rates are thereby reduced. Furthermore, inadequate occlusion of bound Ca2+ following utilization of ATP in Val-304 side-chain mutations is attributed to inadequate stabilization of the Glu-309 side chain and consequent defect of its gating function.},

abstract = {Most research in biology is empirical, yet empirical studies rely fundamentally on theoretical work for generating testable predictions and interpreting observations. Despite this interdependence, many empirical studies build largely on other empirical studies with little direct reference to relevant theory, suggesting a failure of communication that may hinder scientific progress. To investigate the extent of this problem, we analyzed how the use of mathematical equations affects the scientific impact of studies in ecology and evolution. The density of equations in an article has a significant negative impact on citation rates, with papers receiving 28{\%} fewer citations overall for each additional equation per page in the main text. Long, equation-dense papers tend to be more frequently cited by other theoretical papers, but this increase is outweighed by a sharp drop in citations from nontheoretical papers (35{\%} fewer citations for each additional equation per page in the main text). In contrast, equations presented in an accompanying appendix do not lessen a paper's impact. Our analysis suggests possible strategies for enhancing the presentation of mathematical models to facilitate progress in disciplines that rely on the tight integration of theoretical and empirical work.},

abstract = {Hyperamylinemia is common in patients with obesity and insulin resistance, coincides with hyperinsulinemia, and results in amyloid deposition. Amylin amyloids are generally considered a pancreatic disorder in type 2 diabetes. However, elevated circulating levels of amylin may also lead to amylin accumulation and proteotoxicity in peripheral organs, including the heart.
To test whether amylin accumulates in the heart of obese and type 2 diabetic patients and to uncover the effects of amylin accumulation on cardiac morphology and function.
We compared amylin deposition in failing and nonfailing hearts from lean, obese, and type 2 diabetic humans using immunohistochemistry and Western blots. We found significant accumulation of large amylin oligomers, fibrils, and plaques in failing hearts from obese and diabetic patients but not in normal hearts and failing hearts from lean, nondiabetic humans. Small amylin oligomers were even elevated in nonfailing hearts from overweight/obese patients, suggesting an early state of accumulation. Using a rat model of hyperamylinemia transgenic for human amylin, we observed that amylin oligomers attach to the sarcolemma, leading to myocyte Ca(2+) dysregulation, pathological myocyte remodeling, and diastolic dysfunction, starting from prediabetes. In contrast, prediabetic rats expressing the same level of wild-type rat amylin, a nonamyloidogenic isoform, exhibited normal heart structure and function.
Hyperamylinemia promotes amylin deposition in the heart, causing alterations of cardiac myocyte structure and function. We propose that detection and disruption of cardiac amylin buildup may be both a predictor of heart dysfunction and a novel therapeutic strategy in diabetic cardiomyopathy.},

How specificity in binding is attained in the absence of defined structure contrasts with well-established experimental and theoretical work describing ligand binding to protein. The signaling protein calmodulin presents a unique opportunity to investigate mechanisms for target recognition given that it interacts with several hundred different targets. By advancing coarse-grained computer simulations and experimental techniques, mechanistic insights were gained in defining the pathways leading to recognition and in how target selectivity can be achieved at the molecular level. A model requiring mutually induced conformational changes in both calmodulin and target proteins was necessary and broadly informs how proteins can achieve both high affinity and high specificity.},

We report here a combined experimental and mathematical modeling approach to determine the dose-response and the sarcomere length (SL) shortening-frequency relationship of PV in adult rat cardiac myocytes in primary culture. The dose-response was obtained experimentally by observing the PV-transduced myocytes at different time points after gene transfer. Calcium transients and unloaded mechanical contractions were measured. The results were as follows. At low estimated [PV] (∼0.01mM), contractile parameters were unchanged; at intermediate [PV], relaxation rate of the mechanical contraction and the decay rate of the calcium transient increased with little effects on amplitude; and at high [PV] (∼0.1mM), relaxation rate was further increased, but the amplitudes of the mechanical contraction and the calcium transient were diminished when compared with control myocytes. The SL shortening-frequency relationship exhibited a biphasic response to increasing stimulus frequency in controls (decrease in amplitude and re-lengthening time from 0.2 to 1.0Hz followed by an increase in these parameters from 2.0 to 4.0Hz). The effect of PV was to flatten this frequency response. This flattening effect was partly explained by a reduction in the variation in fractional binding of PV to calcium during beats at high frequency. In conclusion, experimental results and mathematical modeling indicate that there is an optimal PV range for which relaxation rate is increased with little effect on contractile amplitude and that PV effectiveness decreases as the stimulus frequency increases.},

abstract = {In this work, a new ansatz is presented that combines molecular dynamics simulations with MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area) to rank the binding affinities of 12 TIBO-like HIV-1 RT inhibitors. Encouraging results have been obtained not only for the relative binding free energies, but also for the absolute ones, which have a root-mean-square deviation of 1.0 kcal/mol (the maximum error is 1.89 kcal/mol). Since the root-mean-square error is rather small, this approach can be reliably applied in ranking the ligands from the databases for this important target. Encouraged by the results, we decided to apply MM-PBSA combined with molecular docking to determine the binding mode of efavirenz SUSTIVA(TM) another promising HIV-1 RT inhibitor for which no ligand-protein crystal structure had been published at the time of this work. To proceed, we define the following ansatz: Five hundred picosecond molecular dynamics simulations were first performed for the five binding modes suggested by DOCK 4.0, and then MM-PBSA was carried out for the collected snapshots. MM-PBSA successfully identified the correct binding mode, which has a binding free energy about 7 kcal/mol more favorable than the second best mode. Moreover, the calculated binding free energy (-13.2 kcal/mol) is in reasonable agreement with experiment (-11.6 kcal/mol). In addition, this procedure was also quite successful in modeling the complex and the structure of the last snapshot was quite close to that of the measured 2,3 A resolution crystal (structure the root-mean-square deviation of the 54 C(alpha) around the binding site and the inhibitor is 1.1 A). We want to point out that this result was achieved without prior knowledge of the structure of the efavirenz/RT complex. Therefore, molecular docking combined with MD simulations followed by MM-PBSA analysis is an attractive approach for modeling protein complexes a priori.},

abstract = {Signals created by local perturbations are known to propagate long distances through proteins via backbone connectivity and nonbonded interactions. In the current study, signal propagation from the flexible ligand binding loop to the rest of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was investigated using frequency response techniques. Using restrained Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD) potential on WPD and R loops, PTP1B was driven between its crystal structure conformations at different frequencies. Propagation of the local perturbation signal was manifested via peaks at the fundamental frequency and upper harmonics of 1/f distributed spectral density of atomic variables, such as C$\alpha$ atoms, dihedral angles, or polar interaction distances. Frequency of perturbation was adjusted high enough (simulation length {\textgreater}∼10×period of a perturbation cycle) not to be clouded by random diffusional fluctuations, and low enough ({\textless}∼0.8 ns(-1)) not to attenuate the propagating signal and enhance the contribution of the side-chains to the dissipation of the signals. Employing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to TMD simulation trajectories of 16 cycles of conformational transitions at periods of 1.2 to 5 ns yielded C$\alpha$ displacements consistent with those obtained from crystal structures. Identification of the perturbed atomic variables by statistical t-tests on log-log scale spectral densities revealed the extent of signal propagation in PTP1B, while phase angles of the filtered trajectories at the fundamental frequency were used to cluster collectively fluctuating elements. Hydrophobic interactions were found to have a higher contribution to signal transduction between side-chains compared to the role of polar interactions. Most of in-phase fluctuating residues on the signaling pathway were found to have high identity among PTP domains, and located over a wide region of PTP1B including the allosteric site. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, the suggested technique may find wide applications in identification of signaling pathways of different proteins.},

abstract = {Contraction of the heart results from interaction of the myosin and actin filaments. Cardiac myosin filaments consist of the molecular motor myosin II, the sarcomeric template protein, titin, and the cardiac modulatory protein, myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C). Inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease caused mainly by mutations in these proteins. The structure of cardiac myosin filaments and the alterations caused by HCM mutations are unknown. We have used electron microscopy and image analysis to determine the three-dimensional structure of myosin filaments from wild-type mouse cardiac muscle and from a MyBP-C knockout model for HCM. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the wild-type filament reveals the conformation of the myosin heads and the organization of titin and MyBP-C at 4 nm resolution. Myosin heads appear to interact with each other intramolecularly, as in off-state smooth muscle myosin [Wendt T, Taylor D, Trybus KM, Taylor K (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:4361-4366], suggesting that all relaxed muscle myosin IIs may adopt this conformation. Titin domains run in an elongated strand along the filament surface, where they appear to interact with part of MyBP-C and with the myosin backbone. In the knockout filament, some of the myosin head interactions are disrupted, suggesting that MyBP-C is important for normal relaxation of the filament. These observations provide key insights into the role of the myosin filament in cardiac contraction, assembly, and disease. The techniques we have developed should be useful in studying the structural basis of other myosin-related HCM diseases.},

abstract = {To investigate whether the energy derived from glycolysis is functionally coupled to Ca2+ active transport in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), we determined whether glycolytic enzymes were associated with SR membranes and whether metabolism through these enzymes was capable of supporting Ca-45 transport. Sealed right-side-out SR vesicles were isolated by step sucrose gradient from rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscle. Intravesicular Ca-45 transport was measured after the addition of glycolytic substrates and cofactors specific for each of the glycolytic reactions being studied or after the addition of exogenous ATP and was expressed as transport sensitive to the specific Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. We found that the entire chain of glycolytic enzymes from aldolase onward, including aldolase, GAPDH, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase (PK), was associated with SR vesicles from both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Iodoacetic acid, an inhibitor of GAPDH, eliminated Ca-45 transport supported by fructose-1,6-diphosphate, the substrate for aldolase, but transport was completely restored by phosphoenolpyruvate (the substrate for PK), indicating that both of the ATP-producing glycolytic enzymes, GAPDH/PGK and PK, were associated with the SR and functionally capable of providing ATP for the Ca2+ pump. Addition of a soluble hexokinase ATP trap eliminated Ca-45 transport fueled by exogenous ATP but had markedly less effect on Ca-45 transport supported by endogenously produced ATP (via glycolysis). Similarly, at very low concentrations of ATP and ADP (10 to 50 nmol/L), ATP that was produced endogenously from ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate supported 15-fold more Ca-45 transport than ATP that was supplied exogenously at the same concentration. These results are consistent with functional coupling of glycolytic ATP to Ca2+ transport and support the hypothesis that ATP generated by SR-associated glycolytic enzymes may play an important role in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis by driving the SR Ca2+ pump.},

Here, we report the 8 {\AA} resolution structure of the rigor (nucleotide-free) actin-tropomyosin-myosin complex determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The pseudoatomic model of the complex, obtained from fitting crystal structures into the map, defines the large interface involving two adjacent actin monomers and one tropomyosin pseudorepeat per myosin contact. Severe forms of hereditary myopathies are linked to mutations that critically perturb this interface. Myosin binding results in a 23 {\AA} shift of tropomyosin along actin. Complex domain motions occur in myosin, but not in actin. Based on our results, we propose a structural model for the tropomyosin-dependent modulation of myosin binding to actin.},

However, theoretical efforts to quantitatively account for such rate enhancement have been hampered by the need to consider a large number of relative configurations of two associating proteins sampled during their diffusional encounter. Our recent work indicates that a good estimate of the rate enhancement is given by the average Boltzmann factor in the region of configurational space where association can effectively take place. This estimate is tested on a model system consisting of two spherical proteins, each with a "reactive patch." Three different forms of interaction potential are considered. Comparison with exact results for the association rate constant demonstrates that predictions based on the local Boltzmann factor are accurate to within approximately 50{\%} for realistic sizes of the reactive region and amplitudes of the interaction potential.},

To investigate how modulation by Mg{\^{}}2{\^{}}+, ATP, and ADP of K"A"T"P and L-type Ca{\^{}}2{\^{}}+ channels influences excitation-contraction coupling, we incorporated equations for intracellular ATP and MgADP regulation of the K"A"T"P current and MgATP regulation of the L-type Ca{\^{}}2{\^{}}+ current in an ionic-metabolic model of the canine ventricular myocyte. The new model: 1), quantitatively reproduces a dose-response relationship for the effects of changes in ATP on K"A"T"P current, 2), simulates effects of ADP in modulating ATP sensitivity of K"A"T"P channel, 3), predicts activation of Ca{\^{}}2{\^{}}+ current during rapid increase in MgATP, and 4), demonstrates that decreased ATP/ADP ratio with normal total Mg{\^{}}2{\^{}}+ or increased free Mg{\^{}}2{\^{}}+ with normal ATP and ADP activate K"A"T"P current, shorten action potential, and alter ionic currents and intracellular Ca{\^{}}2{\^{}}+ signals. The model predictions are in agreement with experimental data measured under normal and a variety of pathological conditions.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which digitalis causes its therapeutic and toxic actions have been studied for nearly a half century, revealing a great deal about cardiac cell regulation of intracellular ions via the Na-K-ATPase (NKA) and how it is altered by cardiac glycosides. However, recent observations suggest that digitalis may have additional effects on cardiac cell function in both the short and long term that include intracellular effects, interactions with specific NKA isoforms in different cellular locations, effects on intracellular (including nuclear) signaling, and long-term regulation of intracellular ionic balances through circulating ouabain-like compounds. The purpose of this review is to examine the current status of a number of the newest and most interesting developments in the study of digitalis with a particular focus on cardiac function, although we will also discuss some of the new advances in other relevant cardiovascular effects. This new information has important implications for both our understanding of ionic regulation in normal and diseased hearts as well as for potential avenues for the development of future therapeutic interventions for the treatment of heart failure.},

abstract = {Oscillations and waves of increased intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) are observed in a wide range of cell types. Because of their inherent nonlinear nature and the consequent unreliability of intuitive approaches, mathematical modeling has an important role to play in the study of these phenomena. One important class of oscillations and waves is dependent on the presence of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from internal stores via the IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channel. With the minimum possible mathematical formalism, we review mechanistic models for IP3-dependent Ca2+ oscillations and waves. These models are based on the regulation of the IP3 receptor by both IP3 and Ca2+, and incorporate experimental data on the steady-state and kinetic properties of the receptor. The extension of the models to describe intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ waves is considered.},

abstract = {Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations are routinely being used to recover the correct canonical probability distributions corresponding to the original potential energy landscape of biomolecular systems. However, the limits of time reweighting, based on transition state theory, in obtaining true kinetic rates from accelerated molecular dynamics for biomolecular systems are less obvious. Here, we investigate this issue by studying the kinetics of cis-trans isomerization of peptidic omega bond by accelerated molecular dynamics. We find that time reweighting is valid for obtaining true kinetics when the original potential is not altered at the transition state regions, as expected. When the original potential landscape is modified such that the applied boost potential alters the transition state regions, time reweighting fails to reproduce correct kinetics and the reweighted rate is much slower than the true rate. By adopting the overdamped limit of Kramers' rate theory, we are successful in recovering correct kinetics irrespective of whether or not the transition state regions are modified. Furthermore, we tested the validity of the acceleration weight factor from the path integral formalism for obtaining the correct kinetics of cis-trans isomerization. It was found that this formulation of the weight factor is not suitable for long time scale processes such as cis-trans isomerization with high energy barriers.},

Most functional analyses of the effects of mutations on cardiac muscle contraction have revealed significant changes in the Ca(2+)-regulatory mechanism, in which cardiac troponin (cTn) plays important structural and functional roles as a key regulatory protein. Over a hundred mutations have been identified in all three subunits of cTn, i.e., cardiac troponins T, I, and C. Recent studies on cTn mutations have provided plenty of evidence that HCM- and RCM-linked mutations increase cardiac myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, while DCM-linked mutations decrease it. This review focuses on the functional consequences of mutations found in cTn in terms of cardiac myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, ATPase activity, force generation, and cardiac troponin I phosphorylation, to understand potential molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms of the three types of inherited cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the Ca-loaded form of pike 4.10 parvalbumin (minor component from pike muscle belonging to the beta phylogenetic series), with both its primary sites CD and EF occupied by Ca2+ ions and its third site occupied by an ammonium ion, as previously determined at 1.93 A resolution, has now been refined to a resolution of 1.65 A. The crystallization of this parvalbumin in different ionic environments has allowed three novel non-isomorphous crystalline forms to be obtained: (1) a first form, crystallized in the presence of a mixture of ammonium sulphate and manganese sulphate, for which all the cation binding sites in the protein are occupied by Mn2+; (2) a second form crystallized in the presence of MgSO4 as the precipitating agent, only differs from the Ca/NH4 form by the occupation of the third site by Mg2+, whereas the primary sites remain occupied by Ca2+; (3) a third form, also crystallized in the presence of MgSO4, corresponds to a well-defined molecular species with both the primary EF site and the third site occupied by Mg2+, whereas the primary CD site remains occupied by CA2+. The corresponding molecular structures reported here have been determined at resolutions between 1.8 and 2.4 A. The comparison of the different crystal structures allows the structural modifications accompanying the substitution of the primary sites by cations differing significantly in their ionic radii (Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+) to be investigated in detail, and it also leads to a precise description of the third site in a typical beta parvalbumin. The substitution Ca2+ by Mg2+ within the primary site EF is characterized by a "contraction" of the co-ordination sphere, with a decrease of the mean oxygen-metal distance by a value of 0.25 A and a decrease of the co-ordination number from 7 to 6, as a consequence of the loss of a bidentate ligand (Glu101), which becomes a monodentate one. Such an adaptation of the co-ordination sphere around a cation of smaller size involves, among others, the transformation of the Glu101 side-chain from the stable gauche(+) form to the less stable gauche(-) form. The third site is clearly described as a satellite of the CD primary site, since both sites possess common protein ligands, such as Asp53 and Glu59. Furthermore, Asp61 appears as a specific ligand of the third site in the different environments investigated in this work. We finally discuss the relevance of the third site to parvalbumin phylogeny.},

abstract = {A new method of simultaneously scaling and shifting the Lennard‐Jones (LJ) potential in molecular dynamics (MD) and thermodynamic integration (TI) simulations is presented. The approach allows the smooth creation or annihilation of atoms or molecules in an ensemble of solvent molecules during a molecular simulation. By scaling and shifting the LJ potential in the direction of the interatomic distance between particles, the method eliminates the problem of the creation or annihilation of a large repulsive LJ potential at the initial or final state of a TI. The optimal degree of shifting and scaling the LJ potential as a function of a control variable $\lambda$ was studied for the annihilation and creation of neon in aqueous solution. The method was further tested on the calculation of the free energy of aqueous solvation of a small molecule, ethanol. In contrast to linear scaling of the LJ potential during TI, the calculated free energies using the new separation‐shifted scaling approach are reasonably well converged after 200–500 ps of simulation and show smaller hysteresis comparing forward and reverse TI.},

abstract = {The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) and its regulatory partner phospholamban (PLN) are essential for myocardial contractility. Arg(9) -{\textgreater} Cys (R9C) and Arg(14) deletion (R14del) mutations in PLN are associated with lethal dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. To better understand these mutations, we made a series of amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN and tested their ability to inhibit SERCA. R9C is a complete loss-of-function mutant of PLN, whereas R14del is a mild loss-of-function mutant. When combined with wild-type PLN to simulate heterozygous conditions, the mutants had a dominant negative effect on SERCA function. A series of targeted mutations in this region of the PLN cytoplasmic domain ((8)TRSAIRR(14)) demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic balance in proper PLN regulation of SERCA. We found that Arg(9) -{\textgreater} Leu and Thr(8) -{\textgreater} Cys substitutions mimicked the behavior of the R9C mutant, and an Arg(14) -{\textgreater} Ala substitution mimicked the behavior of the R14del mutant. The results reveal that the change in hydrophobicity resulting from the R9C and R14del mutations is sufficient to explain the loss of function and persistent interaction with SERCA. Hydrophobic imbalance in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN appears to be a predictor for the development and progression of dilated cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for heart failure. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed as a possible mechanism of cardiac dysfunction in diabetic patients. However, the mechanisms of ROS increase are still elusive. We hypothesized that activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) induced by impaired intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) metabolism may stimulate ROS production in the diabetic heart. Cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats were exposed to high glucose concentrations (25 mmol/L) and ROS levels were analyzed in 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H(2)DCFDA)-loaded cells by flow cytometry analysis. Exposure to high glucose concentrations for 24 h significantly increased CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence, which was significantly inhibited by 1,2-bis (o-aminophenoxy) ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAFTA-AM), a [Ca2+]; chelator, and KB-R7943, an inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) in the reverse mode. These results indicate that [Ca2+]; increase by NCX activation may induce ROS increase following exposure to high glucose concentrations. We confirmed that exposure to high glucose concentrations significantly increased [Ca2+](i), which was inhibited by KB-R7943. Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE) is a key factor in [Ca2+](i) metabolism, and is known to activate NCX by increasing the intracellular Na+ ([Na+](i)) level. We showed that the expression of NHE isoform 1 and NHE activity increased following exposure to high glucose concentrations by evaluating protein expressions and intracellular pH recovery from acid loading. Exposure to high glucose concentrations up-regulated phosphorylated CaMKII expression in cardiomyocytes that was inhibited by KB-R7943. Further, autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP), a CaMKII inhibitor, significantly attenuated the ROS increase following exposure to high glucose concentrations. We confirmed these results obtained in in vitro experiments in an animal model of diabetes. ROS level and components of NADPH oxidase, p47phox and p67phox were up-regulated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat heart, which were attenuated by KN-93, a CaMKII inhibitor. Consistently, expression of phosphorylated CaMKII was increased in the diabetic heart. Activation of CaMKII by impaired [Ca2+](i) metabolism may be a mechanism of ROS increase in the heart with diabetes mellitus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We have estimated the rate of diffusion of calcium ions in the transverse tubules of isolated cardiocytes by recording changes in peak calcium current ( I Ca) caused by rapid changes of the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca]o) at various intervals just preceding activation of I Ca. Isolated ventricular cells of guinea pig heart and atrial cells from rabbit heart were voltage-clamped (whole cell patch), superfused at a high flow rate, and stimulated continuously with depolarizing pulses (0.5 Hz, 200- or 20-ms pulses from a holding potential of −45 or −75 mV to 0 mV). In ventricular cells, the change in peak I Ca following a sudden change of [Ca]oincreased rapidly as the delay between the solution change and depolarization was increased, up to a delay of ∼75 ms [time constant ($\tau$) ≈ 20 ms, 30–40{\%} of total current change), and then increased more slowly ($\tau$ ≈ 200 ms, 60–70{\%} of total current change); 400–500 ms were needed to achieve 90{\%} of the total current increase. In atrial cells, a clear separation into two phases was not possible and 90{\%} of the current change occurred within 85 ms. The slow phase of current change, which was unique to the ventricular cells, presumably reflects the slow equilibration of ions between the bulk perfusate and the lumina of the transverse tubules. If the lengths of the transverse tubules were equal to the cell thickness, the slow rate of change of current would be consistent with an apparent diffusion coefficient for calcium ions of 0.95 × 10−6cm2/s, considerably smaller than the value in bulk solution (7.9 × 10−6cm2/s). Most likely, this discrepancy is due to a high degree of tortuosity in the transverse tubular system in guinea pig ventricular cells or possibly to ion binding sites within the tubular membranes and glycocalyx.},

abstract = {As access to computational resources continues to increase, free-energy calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive role in a wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision.},

abstract = {Heart muscle is activated by Ca(2+) to generate force and shortening, and the signaling pathway involves allosteric mechanisms in the thin filament. Knowledge about the structure-function relationship among proteins in the thin filament is critical in understanding the physiology and pathology of the cardiac function, but remains obscure. We investigate the conformation of the cardiac troponin (Tn) on the thin filament and its response to Ca(2+) activation and propose a molecular mechanism for the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction by Tn based uniquely on information from in situ protein domain orientation. Polarized fluorescence from bifunctional rhodamine is used to determine the orientation of the major component of Tn core domain on the thin filaments of cardiac muscle. We show that the C-terminal lobe of TnC (CTnC) does not move during activation, suggesting that CTnC, together with the coiled coil formed by the TnI and TnT chains (IT arm), acts as a scaffold that holds N-terminal lobe of TnC (NTnC) and the actin binding regions of troponin I. The NTnC, on the other hand, exhibits multiple orientations during both diastole and systole. By combining the in situ orientation data with published in vitro measurements of intermolecular distances, we construct a model for the in situ structure of the thin filament. The conformational dynamics of NTnC plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction by moving the C-terminal region of TnI from its actin-binding inhibitory location and enhancing the movement of tropomyosin away from its inhibitory position.

@article{Ben-Amotz2008,
abstract = {[Figure: see text]. Most chemical processes on earth are intimately linked to the unique properties of water, relying on the versatility with which water interacts with molecules of varying sizes and polarities. These interactions determine everything from the structure and activity of proteins and living cells to the geological partitioning of water, oil, and minerals in the Earth's crust. The role of hydrophobic hydration in the formation of biological membranes and in protein folding, as well as the importance of electrostatic interactions in the hydration of polar and ionic species, are all well known. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hydration are often not as well understood. This Account summarizes and extends emerging understandings of these mechanisms to reveal a newly unified view of hydration and explain previously mystifying observations. For example, rare gas atoms (e.g., Ar) and alkali-halide ions (e.g., K+ and Cl-) have nearly identical experimental hydration entropies, despite the significant charge-induced reorganization of water molecules. Here, we explain how such previously mysterious observations may be understood as arising from Gibbs inequalities, which impose rigorous energetic upper and lower bounds on both hydration free energies and entropies. These fundamental Gibbs bounds depend only on the average interaction energy of a solute with water, thus providing a deep link between solute-water interaction energies and entropies. One of the surprising consequences of the emerging picture is the understanding that the hydration of an ion produces two large but nearly perfectly cancelling, entropic contributions: a negative ion-water interaction entropy and a positive water reorganization entropy. Recent work has also clarified the relationship between the strong cohesive energy of water and the free energy required to form an empty hole (cavity) in water. Here, we explain how linear response theory (whose roots may also be traced to Gibbs inequalities) can provide remarkably accurate descriptions of the process of filling aqueous cavities with nonpolar, polar, or charged molecules. The hydration of nonpolar molecules is well-described by first-order perturbation theory, which implies that turning on solute-water van der Waals interactions does not induce a significant change in water structure. The larger changes in water structure that are induced by polar and ionic solutes are well-described by second-order perturbation theory, which is equivalent to linear response theory. Comparisons of the free energies of nonpolar and polar or ionic solutes may be used to experimentally determine electrostatic contributions to water reorganization energies and entropies. The success of this approach implies that water's ability to respond to solutes of various polarities is far from saturated, as illustrated by simulations of acetonitrile (CH 3CN) in water, which reveal that even such a strongly dipolar solute only produces subtle changes in the structure of water.},

abstract = {During the past 15 years there has been a continuous flow of reports describing proteins stabilized by the introduction of mutations. These reports span a period from pioneering rational design work on small enzymes such as T4 lysozyme and barnase to protein design, and directed evolution. Concomitantly, the purification and characterization of naturally occurring hyperstable proteins has added to our understanding of protein stability. Along the way, many strategies for rational protein stabilization have been proposed, some of which (e.g. entropic stabilization by introduction of prolines or disulfide bridges) have reasonable success rates. On the other hand, comparative studies and efforts in directed evolution have revealed that there are many mutational strategies that lead to high stability, some of which are not easy to define and rationalize. Recent developments in the field include increasing awareness of the importance of the protein surface for stability, as well as the notion that normally a very limited number of mutations can yield a large increase in stability. Another development concerns the notion that there is a fundamental difference between the "laboratory stability" of small pure proteins that unfold reversibly and completely at high temperatures and "industrial stability", which is usually governed by partial unfolding processes followed by some kind of irreversible inactivation process (e.g. aggregation). Provided that one has sufficient knowledge of the mechanism of thermal inactivation, successful and efficient rational stabilization of enzymes can be achieved.},

abstract = {Background-Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. We hypothesized that CaMKII contributes to arrhythmias and underlying cellular events and that inhibition of CaMKII reduces cardiac arrhythmogenesis in vitro and in vivo.Methods and Results-Under baseline conditions, isolated cardiac myocytes from TG mice showed an increased incidence of early afterdepolarizations compared with wild-type myocytes (P {\textless} 0.05). CaMKII inhibition (AIP) completely abolished these afterdepolarizations in TG cells (P {\textless} 0.05). Increasing intracellular Ca stores using ISO (10(-8) M) induced a larger amount of delayed afterdepolarizations and spontaneous action potentials in TG compared with wild-type cells (P {\textless} 0.05). This seems to be due to an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca leak because diastolic [Ca](i) rose clearly on ISO in TG but not in wild-type cells (+20 +/- 5{\%} versus +3 +/- 4{\%} at 10(-6) M ISO, P {\textless} 0.05). In parallel, SR Ca leak assessed by spontaneous SR Ca release events showed an increased Ca spark frequency (3.9 +/- 0.5 versus 2.0 +/- 0.4 sparks per 100 mu m(-1).s(-1), P {\textless} 0.05). However, CaMKII inhibition (either pharmacologically using KN-93 or genetically using an isoform-specific CaMKII delta-knockout mouse model) significantly reduced SR Ca spark frequency, although this rather increased SR Ca content. In parallel, ISO increased the incidence of early (54{\%} versus 4{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05) and late (86{\%} versus 43{\%}, P {\textless} 0.05) nonstimulated events in TG versus wild-type myocytes, but CaMKII inhibition (KN-93 and KO) reduced these proarrhythmogenic events (P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, CaMKII inhibition in TG mice (KN-93) clearly reduced ISO-induced arrhythmias in vivo (P {\textless} 0.05).Conclusions-We conclude that CaMKII contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in TG CaMKII delta(C) mice having heart failure and suggest the increased SR Ca leak as an important mechanism. Moreover, CaMKII inhibition reduces cardiac arrhythmias in vitro and in vivo and may therefore indicate a potential role for future antiarrhythmic therapies warranting further studies.

abstract = {Ca(2+) in cardiac myocytes regulates contractility and relaxation, and Ca(2+) and Na (+)regulation are linked via Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (NCX). Heart failure (HF) is accompanied by contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias, both of which may be due to altered cellular Ca(2+) handling. Smaller Ca(2+) transient and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content cause systolic dysfunction in HF. The reduced SR Ca(2+) content is due to: (a) reduced SR Ca(2+)-ATPase function (which also contributes to diastolic dysfunction), (b) increased expression and function of NCX (which competes with SR Ca(2+)-ATPase during relaxation, but preserves diastolic function), and (c) enhanced diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak. Relative contributions of these may vary with HF etiology and stage. Triggered arrhythmias (e.g., delayed afterdepolarizations [DADs]) are prominent in HF. DADs are due to spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release and consequent activation of transient inward NCX current, which in HF allows DADs to more readily trigger arrhythmogenic action potentials. Thus NCX and Na(+) are critical in systolic and diastolic function and arrhythmias. [Na(+)](i) is elevated in HF, which may limit SR unloading and provide some Ca(2+) influx during the HF action potential, thus limiting the depression of systolic function. High [Na(+)](i) in HF is due to enhanced Na(+) influx. Cellular Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) function appears unaltered, despite reduced NKA expression. This dichotomy led us to test NKA regulation by phospholemman (PLM). We find that PLM regulates NKA in a manner analogous to phospholamban regulation of SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (i.e., inhibition that is relieved by PLM phosphorylation). We measured intermolecular FRET between PLM and NKA, which is reduced upon PLM phosphorylation. The lower expression level of more phosphorylated PLM in HF may explain the above dichotomy. Thus, altered Ca(2+) and Na(+) handling contributes to altered contractile function and arrhythmogenesis in HF.},

abstract = {Rat alpha- and beta-parvalbumins have distinct monovalent cation-binding properties [Henzl et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 5859-5867]. Beta binds two Na(+) or one K(+), and alpha binds one Na(+) and no K(+). Ca(2+) abolishes these binding events, suggesting that the monovalent ions occupy the EF-hand motifs. This study compares alpha and beta divalent ion affinities in Na(+) and K(+) solutions. Solvent cation identity seriously affects alpha. In Hepes-buffered NaCl, at 5 degrees C, the macroscopic Ca(2+)-binding constants are 2.6 x 10(8) and 6.4 x 10(7) M(-1) and the Mg(2+) constants, 1.8 x 10(4) and 4.3 x 10(3) M(-1). In Hepes-buffered KCl, the Ca(2+) values increase to 2.9 x 10(9) and 6.6 x 10(8) M(-1) and the Mg(2+) values to 2.2 x 10(5) and 3.7 x 10(4) M(-1). Monte Carlo simulation of alpha binding data-employing site-specific constants and explicitly considering Na(+) binding-yields a K(Na) of 630 M(-1) and indicates that divalent ion-binding is positively cooperative. NMR data suggest that the lone Na(+) ion occupies the CD loop. Solvent cation identity has a smaller impact on beta. In Na(+), the Ca(2+) constants for the EF and CD sites are 2.3 x 10(7) and 1.5 x 10(6) M(-1), respectively; the Mg(2+) constants are 9.2 x 10(3) and 1.7 x 10(2) M(-1). In K(+), these values shift to 3.1 x 10(7) and 3.8 x 10(6) M(-1) and the latter to 1.4 x 10(4) and 2.9 x 10(2) M(-1). These data suggest that parvalbumin divalent ion affinity, particularly that of rat alpha, can be significantly attenuated by increased intracellular Na(+) levels.},

An identical CaM protein consisting of four helix-loop-helix regions that arose by gene duplication is encoded by three nonallelic mammalian genes that are some of the most highly conserved genes known. Differential tissue and cellular expression of each CaM suggest unique functions that promote strong selective preservation of these replicate, yet distinct, CaM genes in mammals. Each gene displays the same exon-intron arrangement but is characterized by distinct promoter elements and by unique 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions that are highly conserved among human, rat, and mouse. These distinct untranslated regions may permit regulation of CaM levels at discrete cellular sites during differentiation and in highly specialized cell types such as neurons.},

However, pathways that connect two-end structures and how they are coupled to the binding reaction are not well understood at atomic resolution. Here, we analyzed the free-energy landscape, explicitly taking into account coupling between binding and conformational change by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for Ca2+ binding to a calmodulin loop. Using the AMBER force field with explicit water solvent, we conducted umbrella sampling for the free-energy surface and steered molecular dynamics for the pathway search. We found that, at an early stage of binding, some key residue side chains extend their "arms" to catch Ca2+ and, after catching, they carry the Ca2+ to the center of the binding pocket. This grabbing motion resulted in smooth and stepwise exchange in coordination partners of Ca2+ from water oxygen to atoms in the calmodulin loop. The key residue that first caught the ion was one of the two acidic residues, which are highly conserved. In the pathway simulations, different pathways were observed between binding and dissociation reactions: The former was more diverse than the latter.},

@article{Goldbeter2013,
abstract = {Oscillations occur in a number of enzymatic systems as a result of feedback regulation. How Michaelis-Menten kinetics influences oscillatory behavior in enzyme systems is investigated in models for oscillations in the activity of phosphofructokinase (PFK) in glycolysis and of cyclin-dependent kinases in the cell cycle. The model for the PFK reaction is based on a product-activated allosteric enzyme reaction coupled to enzymatic degradation of the reaction product. The Michaelian nature of the product decay term markedly influences the period, amplitude and waveform of the oscillations. Likewise, a model for oscillations of Cdc2 kinase in embryonic cell cycles based on Michaelis-Menten phosphorylation-dephosphorylation kinetics shows that the occurrence and amplitude of the oscillations strongly depend on the ultrasensitivity of the enzymatic cascade that controls the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase.

Examples are gene regulatory networks or protein interaction maps. The main challenge in the analysis of these data is to read off biological functions from the topology of the network. Topological motifs, i.e., patterns occurring repeatedly at different positions in the network, have recently been identified as basic modules of molecular information processing. In this article, we discuss motifs derived from families of mutually similar but not necessarily identical patterns. We establish a statistical model for the occurrence of such motifs, from which we derive a scoring function for their statistical significance. Based on this scoring function, we develop a search algorithm for topological motifs called graph alignment, a procedure with some analogies to sequence alignment. The algorithm is applied to the gene regulation network of Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive ability and is a serious cause of mortality. Many of the pathological characteristics associated with AD are revealed post-mortem, including amyloid-$\beta$ plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex. Although several genetic mutations and risk factors have been associated with the disease, the causes remain poorly understood. Study of disease-initiating mechanisms and AD progression in humans is inherently difficult as most available tissue specimens are from late-stages of disease. Therefore, AD researchers rely on in vitro studies and the use of AD animal models where neuroinflammation has been shown to be a major characteristic of AD. Purinergic receptors are a diverse family of proteins consisting of P1 adenosine receptors and P2 nucleotide receptors for ATP, UTP and their metabolites. This family of receptors has been shown to regulate a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including neuroinflammation, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and AD. Experimental evidence from human AD tissue has suggested that purinergic receptors may play a role in AD progression and studies using selective purinergic receptor agonists and antagonists in vitro and in AD animal models have demonstrated that purinergic receptors represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

abstract = {The adenylyl cyclases are variously regulated by G protein subunits, a number of serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases, and Ca2+. In some physiological situations, this regulation can be readily incorporated into a hormonal cascade, controlling processes such as cardiac contractility or neurotransmitter release. However, the significance of some modes of regulation is obscure and is likely only to be apparent in explicit cellular contexts (or stages of the cell cycle). The regulation of many of the ACs by the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ provides an overarching mechanism for integrating the activities of these two major signaling systems. Elaborate devices have been evolved to ensure that this interaction occurs, to guarantee the fidelity of the interaction, and to insulate the microenvironment in which it occurs. Subcellular targeting, as well as a variety of scaffolding devices, is used to promote interaction of the ACs with specific signaling proteins and regulatory factors to generate privileged domains for cAMP signaling. A direct consequence of this organization is that cAMP will exhibit distinct kinetics in discrete cellular domains. A variety of means are now available to study cAMP in these domains and to dissect their components in real time in live cells. These topics are explored within the present review.},

abstract = {In this article, the available evidence about the functional effects of the contractile protein mutations that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is assessed. The molecular mechanism of the contractile apparatus of cardiac muscle and its regulation by Ca2+ and PKA phosphorylation have been extensively studied. Therefore, when a number of point mutations in the contractile protein genes were found to cause the well-defined phenotypes of HCM and DCM, it was expected that the diseases could be explained at the molecular level. However, the search for a distinctive molecular phenotype did not yield rapid results. Now that a substantial number of mutations that cause HCM or DCM have been investigated in physiologically relevant systems and with a range of experimental techniques, a pattern is emerging. In the case of HCM, the hypothesis that the major effect of mutations is to increase myofibrillar Ca2+-sensitivity seems to be well established, but the mechanisms by which an increase in myofibrillar Ca2+-sensitivity induces hypertrophy remain obscure. In contrast, DCM mutations are not correlated with a specific effect on Ca2+-sensitivity. It has recently been proposed that DCM mutations uncouple troponin I phosphorylation from Ca2+-sensitivity changes, albeit based on only a few mutations so far. A plausible link between uncoupling and DCM has been proposed via blunting of the response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation.},

@article{Allo1991,
abstract = {Non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD) male Wistar rats develop a cardiomyopathy approximately 9 mo after the onset of the diabetic condition. This cardiomyopathy is characterized by reduced contractility, relaxation, cardiac work, and diastolic compliance. Although the basis for these defects is not completely understood, altered cellular Ca2+ regulation appears to play a major role in their development. In both isolated sarcolemmal membrane and cardiomyocytes, significant diabetes-linked defects in Ca2+ metabolism were observed. A small, but significant, decrease in the rate of sarcolemmal ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport of the diabetic heart was observed. Also evident was a major defect in sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange as determined by reduced Na+-dependent Ca2+ transport into vesicles and Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux from Ca-45(2+)-loaded cardiomyocytes from diabetic rats. In isolated cardiomyocytes, it was observed that the relative fluorescence of fura-2 at 502 nm was higher in cells from NIDD hearts, suggestive of a higher cytosolic free Ca2+. Consistent with diabetes-linked defects in Ca2+-transporter activities, the accumulation of Ca2+ after depolarization with KCl was greater in the diabetic. This study demonstrates that diabetes-induced defects in Ca2+ movement by the various Ca2+ transporters lead to abnormal cytosolic Ca2+ regulation by the diabetic cardiomyocytes. This observation supports the notion that abnormal Ca2+ regulation contributes to the development of the NIDD cardiomyopathy.},

When the two surfaces are solvophilic and solvophobic, these particles constitute the simplest example of surfactants. The phase diagram includes a colloidal-poor (gas), colloidal-rich (liquid) demixing region, which is progressively suppressed by the insurgence of micelles, providing the first model in which micellization and phase separation are simultaneously observed. The coexistence curve is found to be negatively sloped in the temperature-pressure plane, suggesting that Janus particles can provide a colloidal system with anomalous thermodynamic behavior.},

The workshop strove to identify limitations in the use of data from nonhuman animal species for elucidation of human electromechanical function/activity and to identify what specific information on ion channel kinetics, calcium handling, and dynamic changes in the intracellular/extracellular milieu is needed from human cardiac tissues to develop more robust computational models of human cardiac electromechanical activity. This article summarizes the workshop discussions and recommendations on the following topics: (1) limitations of animal models and differences from human electrophysiology, (2) modeling ion channel structure/function in the context of whole-cell electrophysiology, ( 3) excitation-contraction coupling and regulatory pathways, (4) whole-heart simulations of human electromechanical activity, and (5) what human data are currently needed and how to obtain them.

abstract = {Viral infection of mammalian host results in the activation of innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been shown to mediate the recognition of many types of pathogens, including viruses. The genomes of viruses possess unique characteristics that are not found in mammalian genomes, such as high CpG content and double-stranded RNA. These genomic nucleic acids serve as molecular signatures associated with viral infections. Here we show that TLR7 recognizes the single-stranded RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. The recognition of these viruses by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells through TLR7 results in their activation of costimulatory molecules and production of cytokines. Moreover, this recognition required intact endocytic pathways. Mice deficient in either the TLR7 or the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 demonstrated reduced responses to in vivo infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. These results demonstrate microbial ligand recognition by TLR7 and provide insights into the pathways used by the innate immune cells in the recognition of viral pathogens.},

abstract = {1. The variation of isometric tetanus tension with sarcomere length in single fibres from frog striated muscle has been re-investigated with special precautions to ensure uniformity of sarcomere length within the part of the fibre being studied.2. In most respects the results of Ramsey {\&} Street (1940) were confirmed, but (a) the peak of the curve was found to consist of a plateau between sarcomere lengths of 2.05 and 2.2 mu, (b) the decline of tension above this plateau is steeper than found by Ramsey {\&} Street, and (c) the decline of tension below the plateau becomes suddenly steeper at a sarcomere length of about 1.67 mu.3. Many features of this length-tension relation are simply explained on the sliding-filament theory.4. It is concluded that, in the plateau and at greater lengths, the tension on each thin filament is made up of equal contributions from each bridge which it overlaps on adjacent thick filaments.5. Internal resistance to shortening is negligible in this range but becomes progressively more important with shortening below the plateau.},

Inhibition of SERCA pumps induces desynchronized RyR activation in overloaded internal Ca2+ stores in smooth muscle cells. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 298: C1038-C1046, 2010. First published January 27, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00222.2009.-We have previously shown that rapid inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ATPase (SERCA pumps) decreases the amplitude and rate of rise (synchronization) of caffeine induced-Ca2+ release without producing a reduction of free luminal SR Ca2+ level in smooth muscle cells (Gomez-Viquez L, Guerrero-Serna G, Garcia U, Guerrero-Hernandez A. Biophys J 85: 370-380, 2003). Our aim was to investigate the role of luminal SR Ca2+ content in the communication between ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and SERCA pumps. To this end, we studied the effect of SERCA pump inhibition on RyR-mediated Ca2+ release in smooth muscle cells with overloaded SR Ca2+ stores. Under this condition, the amplitude of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release was not affected but the rate of rise was still decreased. In addition, the caffeine-induced Ca2+-dependent K+ outward currents revealed individual events, suggesting that SERCA pump inhibition reduces the coordinated activation of RyRs. Collectively, our results indicate that SERCA pumps facilitate the activation of RyRs by a mechanism that does not involve the regulation of SR Ca2+ content. Importantly, SERCA pumps and RyRs colocalize in smooth muscle cells, suggesting a possible local communication between these two proteins.},

abstract = {A general formalism is developed for calculating the time-dependent rate coefficient k(t) of an irreversible diffusion-influenced reaction. This formalism allows one to treat most factors that affect k(t), including rotational Brownian motion and conformational gating of reactant molecules and orientation constraint for product formation. At long times k(t) is shown to have the asymptotic expansion k(infinity)[1 + k(infinity)(pi Dt)(-1/2)/4 pi D + ...] where D is the relative translational diffusion constant. An approximate analytical method for calculating k(t) is presented. This is based on the approximation that the probability density of the reactant pair in the reactive region keeps the equilibrium distribution but with a decreasing amplitude. The rate coefficient then is determined by the Green function in the absence of chemical reaction, Within the framework of this approximation, two general relations are obtained. The first relation allows the rate coefficient for an arbitrary amplitude of the reactivity to be found if the rate coefficient for one amplitude of the reactivity is is known. The second relation allows the rate coefficient in the presence of conformational gating to be found from that in the absence of conformational gating. The ratio k(t)/k(0) is shown to be the survival probability of the reactant pair at time t starting from an initial distribution that is localized in the reactive region. This relation forms the basis of the calculation of k(t) through Brownian dynamic's simulations. Two simulation procedures involving the propagation of nonreactive trajectories initiated only from the reactive region are described and illustrated on a model system. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the equilibrium-distribution approximation method.},

abstract = {The defects identified in the mechanical activity of the hearts from type 1 diabetic animals include alteration of Ca2+ signaling via changes in critical processes that regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration. These defects result partially from a dysfunction of cardiac ryanodine receptor calcium release channel (RyR2). The present study was designed to determine whether the properties of the Ca2+ sparks might provide insight into the role of RyR2 in the altered Ca2+ signaling in cardiomyocytes from diabetic animals when they were analyzed together with Ca2+ transients. Basal Ca2+ level as well as Ca2+ -spark frequency of cardiomyoctes isolated from 5-week streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats significantly increased with respect to aged-matched control rats. Ca2+ transients exhibited significantly reduced amplitude and prolonged time courses as well as depressed Ca2+ loading of sarcoplasmic reticulum. in diabetic rats. Spatio-temporal properties of the Ca2+ sparks in cardiomyocytes isolated from diabetic rats were also significantly altered to being almost parallel to the changes of Ca2+ transients. In addition, RyR2 from diabetic rat hearts were hyperphosphorylated and protein levels of both RyR2 and FKBP12.6 depleted. These data show that STZ-induced diabetic rat hearts exhibit altered local Ca2+ signaling with increased basal Ca2+ level.},

@article{Zhou1998,
abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase, with an active site located at the bottom of a narrow and deep gorge, provides a striking example of enzymes with buried active sites. Recent molecular dynamics simulations showed that reorientation of five aromatic rings leads to rapid opening and closing of the gate to the active site. In the present study the molecular dynamics trajectory is used to quantitatively analyze the effect of the gate on the substrate binding rate constant. For a 2. 4-A probe modeling acetylcholine, the gate is open only 2.4{\%} of the time, but the quantitative analysis reveals that the substrate binding rate is slowed by merely a factor of 2. We rationalize this result by noting that the substrate, by virtue of Brownian motion, will make repeated attempts to enter the gate each time it is near the gate. If the gate is rapidly switching between the open and closed states, one of these attempts will coincide with an open state, and then the substrate succeeds in entering the gate. However, there is a limit on the extent to which rapid gating dynamics can compensate for the small equilibrium probability of the open state. Thus the gate is effective in reducing the binding rate for a ligand 0.4 A bulkier by three orders of magnitude. This relationship suggests a mechanism for achieving enzyme specificity without sacrificing efficiency.},

Around physiological pH, all acidic Ca2+ ligands (Glu(309), Glu(771), Asp(800), and Glu(908)) were unprotonated in Ca(2)E1; in E2(TG) and E2(TG+MgF42-) Glu(771), Asp(800), and Glu(908) were protonated. Glu(771) and Glu(908) had calculated pKa values larger than 14 in E2(TG) and E2(TG+MgF42-), whereas Asp 800 titrated with calculated pKa values near 7.5. Glu(309) had very different pKa values in the Ca2+-free states: 8.4 in E2(TG+MgF42-) and 4.7 in E2( TG) because of a different local backbone conformation. This indicates that Glu(309) can switch between a high and a low pKa mode, depending on the local backbone conformation. Protonated Glu(309) occupied predominantly two main, very differently orientated side-chain conformations in E2(TG+MgF42-): one oriented inward toward the other Ca21 ligands and one oriented outward toward a protein channel that seems to be in contact with the cytoplasm. Upon deprotonation, Glu(309) adopted completely the outwardly orientated side-chain conformation. The contact of Glu(309) with the cytoplasm in E2(TG+MgF42-) makes this residue unlikely to bind lumenal protons. Instead it might serve as a proton shuttle between Ca2+ binding site I and the cytoplasm. Glu(771), Asp(800), and Glu(908) are proposed to take part in proton countertransport.},

abstract = {The frequently observed ankyrin repeat motif represents a structural scaffold evolved for mediating protein-protein interactions. As such, these repeats modulate a diverse range of cellular functions. We thermodynamically characterized the heterodimeric GA-binding protein (GABP) alpha beta complex and focused specifically on the interaction mediated by the ankyrin repeat domain of the GABP. Our isothermal titration calorimetric analysis of the interaction between the GABP subunits determined an association constant (K-A) of 6.0 X 10(8)M(-1) and that the association is favorably driven by a significant change in enthalpy (Delta H) and a minor change in entropy (-T Delta S). A total of 16 GABP interface residues were chosen for alanine scanning mutagenesis. The calorimetrically measured differences in the free energy of binding were compared to computationally calculated values resulting in a correlation coefficient r = 0.71. We identified three spatially contiguous hydrophobic and aromatic residues that form a binding free energy hot spot (Delta Delta G {\textgreater} 2.0 kcal/mol). One residue provides structural support to the hot spot residues. Three non-hot spot residues are intermediate contributors (Delta Delta G similar to 1.0 kcal/mol) and create a canopy-like structure over the hot spot residues to possibly occlude solvent and orientate the subunits. The remaining interface residues are located peripherally and have weak contributions. Finally, our mutational analysis revealed a significant entropy-enthalpy compensation for this interaction.

abstract = {
The catalytic conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by adenylate kinase (ADK) involves large amplitude, ligand induced domain motions, involving the opening and the closing of ATP binding domain (LID) and AMP binding domain (NMP) domains, during the repeated catalytic cycle. We discover and analyze an interesting dynamical coupling between the motion of the two domains during the opening, using large scale atomistic molecular dynamics trajectory analysis, covariance analysis, and multidimensional free energy calculations with explicit water. Initially, the LID domain must open by a certain amount before the NMP domain can begin to open. Dynamical correlation map shows interesting cross-peak between LID and NMP domain which suggests the presence of correlated motion between them. This is also reflected in our calculated two-dimensional free energy surface contour diagram which has an interesting elliptic shape, revealing a strong correlation between the opening of the LID domain and that of the NMP domain. Our free energy surface of the LID domain motion is rugged due to interaction with water and the signature of ruggedness is evident in the observed root mean square deviation variation and its fluctuation time correlation functions. We develop a correlated dynamical disorder-type theoretical model to explain the observed dynamic coupling between the motion of the two domains in ADK. Our model correctly reproduces several features of the cross-correlation observed in simulations.},

abstract = {In the presence of rapid buffers the full reaction-diffusion equations describing Ca2+ transport can be reduced using the rapid buffering approximation to a single transport equation for [Ca2+]. Here we simulate the full and reduced equations, exploring the conditions necessary for the validity of the rapid buffering approximation for an isolated Ca2+ channel or a cluster of channels. Using a point source and performing numerical simulations of different durations, we quantify the error of the rapid buffering approximation as a function of buffer and source parameters as well as the time and spatial scale set by the resolution of confocal microscopic measurements. We carry out simulations of Ca2+ ''sparks'' and ''puffs,'' both with and without the indicator dye Ca2+ Green-1, and find that the rapid buffering approximation is excellent. These calculations also show that the traditional calculation of [Ca2+] from a fluorescence signal may grossly underestimate the true value of [Ca2+] near a source. Finally, we use the full model to simulate the transient Ca2+ domain near the pore of an open Ca2+ channel in a cell dialyzed with millimolar concentrations of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N, N-tetraacetic acid or EGTA. In this regime, where the rapid buffering approximation is poor, Neher's equation for the steady-state Ca2+ profile is shown to be a reliable approximation adjacent to the pore.},

We show that AKAP18 delta acts as a scaffold that coordinates PKA phosphorylation of PLN and the adrenergic effect on Ca2+ re- uptake. Inhibition of the compartmentalization of this cAMP signalling complex by specific molecular disruptors interferes with the phosphorylation of PLN. This prevents the subsequent release of PLN from SERCA2, thereby affecting the Ca2+ re- uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum induced by adrenergic stimuli.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work was the development of a basal mathematical model for the diffusion of low-molecular metabolites in a skeletal muscle cell. A three-dimension diffusion of low-molecular particles was simulated by a Monte-Carlo method (random walks of diffusing molecules). The model takes into account the following structural elements: (i) a regular lattice of actin and myosin filaments inside a myofibril; (ii) the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria surrounding the myofibrils; (iii) a set of myofibrils inside a skeletal muscle cell. We simulated diffusion of particles in the bulk of intracellular water phase and their reflections from the rigid surfaces of intracellular structures. The model allowed to calculate the apparent coefficients of particle diffusion in the axial and radial directions, Dparallel(app) and Dperpendicular(app), respectively. In accordance with experimental data from literature, the coefficient Dparallel(app) was independent of time. The coefficient of radial diffusion Dperpendicular(app) decreased with time to steady state values similar to that determined by the NMR diffusion spectroscopy methods. The interactions of diffusing particles with thin and thick filaments of myofibrils could explain the decrease in the Dperpendicular(app) value by a factor of 20{\%}. The collisions of particles with myofilaments began to reveal themselves as a gradual decrease in the Dperpendicular(app) value at early stages of diffusion (t1/2 approximately equal to 0.05 microsec). The contribution of particle reflections from the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to the retardation of the radial diffusion was about of 20-30{\%}, depending on porosity of a membranous shield around the myofibril. For conventional sizes of a membranous shield (diameter 2 microm), the interactions of particles with the shield caused a decrease in the Dperpendicular(app) value with a half-time t1/2 approximately equal to 0.5 msec. This time is essentially lower by a factor about of 100 than that found in published NMR measurements. When we considered diffusion of particles inside a cell compartment confined to impermeable membranous shield, the reflection of particles from this shield led the drastic decrease in the radial diffusion coefficient (Dperpendicular(app) --{\textgreater} porportional to when t --{\textgreater} porportional to). This pattern of the Dperpendicular(app)(t) time-course might be expected in the NMR measurements on skeletal muscle tissue where a sarcolemma represents an impermeable shield for ATP and PCr molecules.},

abstract = {EF-hand Ca(II) binding sites share a conserved architecture and are prevalent in Ca(II) signaling pathways. The ion binding kinetics of these sites are carefully tuned to provide the physiologically appropriate activation and inactivation time scales. Here we examine kinetic tuning by the side chain at the ninth position of the EF-loop. A model is proposed in which both the size and charge of the side chain contribute to kinetic tuning. To test this model, the ninth loop position of the EF-hand-like site in the Escherichia coli D-galactose binding protein has been engineered and the Tb(III) dissociation kinetics of the resulting sites have been analyzed. Substitutions at this position are observed to generate up to 10(4)-fold changes in Tb(III) dissociation rates, with little effect on Tb(III) affinity. Furthermore, the observed pattern of rate changes confirm the model's predictions; long side chains at the ninth loop position yield slow dissociation kinetics as predicted for a steric block, whereas acidic side chains yield slow dissociation kinetics as expected for an electrostatic barrier.},

Here, with the aid of low-resolution X-ray crystallography, we present direct structural information on membrane interfaces as delineated by lipid phosphate groups surrounding the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in its phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Ca(2+)-free forms. The protein-lipid interactions are further analysed using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that SERCA adapts to membranes of different hydrophobic thicknesses by inducing local deformations in the lipid bilayers and by undergoing small rearrangements of the amino-acid side chains and helix tilts. These mutually adaptive interactions allow smooth transitions through large conformational changes associated with the transport cycle of SERCA, a strategy that may be of general nature for many membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Tortuosity of the extracellular space describes hindrance posed to the diffusion process by a geometrically complex medium in comparison to an environment free of any obstacles. Calculating tortuosity in biologically relevant geometries is difficult. Yet this parameter has proved very important for many processes in the brain, ranging from ischemia and osmotic stress to delivery of nutrients and drugs. It is also significant for interpretation of the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance data. We use a volume-averaging procedure to obtain a general expression for tortuosity in a complex environment. A simple approximation then leads to tortuosity estimates in a number of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) geometries characterized by narrow pathways between the cellular elements. It also explains the counterintuitive fact of lower diffusion hindrance in a 3D environment. Comparison with Monte Carlo numerical simulations shows that the model gives reasonable tortuosity estimates for a number of regular and randomized 2D and 3D geometries. Importantly, it is shown that addition of dead-end pores increases tortuosity in proportion to the square root of enlarged total extracellular volume fraction. This conclusion is further supported by the previously described tortuosity decrease in ischemic brain slices where dead-end pores were partially occluded by large macromolecules introduced into the extracellular space.},

abstract = {We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect and quantitate the interaction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) with phospholamban (PLB) in membranes. PLB inhibits SERCA only at submicromolar Ca. It has been proposed that relief of inhibition at micromolar Ca is due to dissociation of the inhibitory complex. To test this hypothesis, we co-reconstituted donor-labeled SERCA and acceptor-labeled I40A-PLB (superinhibitory, monomeric PLB mutant) in membranes of defined lipid and protein composition, with full retention of Ca-dependent ATPase activity and inhibitory regulation by PLB. FRET from SERCA to PLB was measured as a function of membrane concentrations of PLB and SERCA, and functional activity was measured on the same samples. The data revealed clearly that the stoichiometry of binding is one PLB per SERCA, and that binding is a strict function of the ratio of total PLB to SERCA in the membrane. We conclude that the dissociation constant of PLB binding to SERCA is far less than physiological PLB membrane concentrations. Binding at low Ca (pCa 6.5), where I40A-PLB inhibits SERCA, was virtually identical to that at high Ca (pCa 5.0), where no inhibition was observed. However, the limiting energy transfer at saturating PLB was less at high Ca, indicating a greater donor-acceptor distance. We conclude that (a) the affinity of PLB for SERCA is so great that PLB is essentially a SERCA subunit under physiological conditions and (b) relief of inhibition at micromolar Ca is due to a structural rearrangement within the SERCA-PLB complex, rather than dissociation.},

abstract = {Protein kinase C phosphorylation of cardiac troponin, the Ca(2+)-sensing switch in muscle contraction, is capable of modulating the response of cardiac muscle to a Ca(2+) ion concentration. The N-domain of cardiac troponin I contains two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. Although the physiological consequences of phosphorylation at Ser(43)/Ser(45) are known, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these functional changes have yet to be established. In this work, NMR was used to identify conformational and dynamic changes in cardiac troponin C upon binding a phosphomimetic troponin I, having Ser(43)/Ser(45) mutated to Asp. Chemical shift perturbation mapping indicated that residues in helix G were most affected. Smaller chemical shift changes were observed in residues located in the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-binding loops. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates in the C-lobe of troponin C were compared in complexes containing either the wild-type or phosphomimetic N-domain of troponin I. In the presence of a phosphomimetic domain, exchange rates in helix G increased, whereas a decrease in exchange rates for residues mapping to Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-binding loops III and IV was observed. Increased exchange rates are consistent with destabilization of the Thr(129)-Asp(132) helix capping box previously characterized in helix G. The perturbation of helix G and metal binding loops III and IV suggests that phosphorylation alters metal ion affinity and inter-subunit interactions. Our studies support a novel mechanism for protein kinase C signal transduction, emphasizing the importance of C-lobe Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-dependent troponin interactions.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a small protein involved in calcium signaling; among the targets of CaM are a number of kinases, including myosin light chain kinases (MLCK), various CaM-dependent kinases and phosphorylase kinase. We present results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 4-ns length for calmodulin in its three functional forms: calcium-free, calcium-loaded, and in complex with both calcium and a target peptide, a fragment of the smooth muscle MLCK. The simulations included explicit water under realistic conditions of constant temperature and pressure, the presence of counterions and Ewald summation of electrostatic forces. Our simulation results present a more complete description of calmodulin structure, dynamics and interactions in solution than previously available. The results agree with a wide range of experimental data, including X-ray, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fluorescence, cross-linking, mutagenesis and thermodynamics. Additionally, we are able to draw interesting conclusions about microscopic properties related to the protein's biological activity. First.. in accord with fluorescence data, we find that calcium-free and calcium-loaded calmodulin exhibit significant structural flexibility. Our simulations indicate that these motions may be described as rigid-body translations and rotations of the N- and C-terminal domains occurring on a nanosecond time scale. Our second conclusion deals with the standard model of calmodulin action, which is that calcium binding leads to solvent exposure of hydrophobic patches in the two globular domains, which thus become ready to interact with the target. Surprisingly, the simulation results are inconsistent with the activation model when the standard definitions of the hydrophobic patches are used, based on hydrophobic clefts found in the X-ray structure of calcium-loaded calmodulin. We find that both experimental and simulation results are consistent with the activation model after a redefinition of the hydrophobic patches as those residues which are actually involved in peptide binding in the experimental structure of the calmodulin-peptide complex. The third conclusion is that the calmodulin-peptide interactions in the complex are very strong and are dominated by hydrophobic effects. Using quasi-harmonic entropy calculations, we find that these strong interactions induce a significant conforinational strain in the protein and peptide. This destabilizing entropic contribution leads to a moderate overall binding free energy in the complex. Our results provide interesting insights into calmodulin binding to its kinase targets. The flexibility of the protein may explain the fact that CaM is able to bind many different targets. The large loss of conformational entropy upon CaM:peptide binding cancels the entropy gain due to hydrophobic interactions. This explains why the observed entropic contribution to the binding free energy is small and positive, and not large and negative as expected for a complex with such extensive hydrophobic contacts.

abstract = {Abnormal release of Ca from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) may contribute to contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis in heart failure (HF). We previously demonstrated decreased Ca transient amplitude and SR Ca load associated with increased Na/Ca exchanger expression and enhanced diastolic SR Ca leak in an arrhythmogenic rabbit model of nonischemic HF. Here we assessed expression and phosphorylation status of key Ca handling proteins and measured SR Ca leak in control and HF rabbit myocytes. With HF, expression of RyR2 and FK-506 binding protein 12.6 (FKBP12.6) were reduced, whereas inositol trisphosphate receptor (type 2) and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) expression were increased 50{\%} to 100{\%}. The RyR2 complex included more CaMKII (which was more activated) but less calmodulin, FKBP12.6, and phosphatases 1 and 2A. The RyR2 was more highly phosphorylated by both protein kinase A (PKA) and CaMKII. Total phospholamban phosphorylation was unaltered, although it was reduced at the PKA site and increased at the CaMKII site. SR Ca leak in intact HF myocytes ( which is higher than in control) was reduced by inhibition of CaMKII but was unaltered by PKA inhibition. CaMKII inhibition also increased SR Ca content in HF myocytes. Our results suggest that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2 is involved in enhanced SR diastolic Ca leak and reduced SR Ca load in HF, and may thus contribute to arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction in HF.},

@article{Obiol-Pardo2011,
abstract = {The preclinical assessment of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia, a major concern for regulators, is typically based on experimental or computational models focused on the potassium channel hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene, K(v)11.1). Even if the role of this ion channel in the ventricular repolarization is of critical importance, the complexity of the events involved make the cardiac safety assessment based only on hERG has a high risk of producing either false positive or negative results. We introduce a multiscale simulation system aiming to produce a better cardiotoxicity assessment. At the molecular scale, the proposed system uses a combination of docking simulations on two potassium channels, hERG and KCNQ1, plus three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling for predicting how the tested compound will block the potassium currents IK(r) and IK(s). The obtained results have been introduced in electrophysiological models of the cardiomyocytes and the ventricular tissue, allowing the direct prediction of the drug effects on electrocardiogram simulations. The usefulness of the whole method is illustrated by predicting the cardiotoxic effect of several compounds, including some examples in which classic hERG-based models produce false positive or negative results, yielding correct predictions for all of them. These results can be considered a proof of concept, suggesting that multiscale prediction systems can be suitable for being used for preliminary screening in lead discovery, before the compound is physically available, or in early preclinical development when they can be fed with experimentally obtained data.},

@article{Rumi-Masante2012,
abstract = {The highly conserved phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) plays vital roles in numerous processes including T-cell activation, development and function of the central nervous system, and cardiac growth. It is activated by the calcium sensor calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to a regulatory domain (RD) within CaN, causing a conformational change that displaces an autoinhibitory domain (AID) from the active site, resulting in activation of the phosphatase. This is the same general mechanism by which CaM activates CaM-dependent protein kinases. Previously published data have hinted that the RD of CaN is intrinsically disordered. In this work, we demonstrate that the RD is unstructured and that it folds upon binding CaM, ousting the AID from the catalytic site. The RD is 95 residues long, with the AID attached to its C-terminal end and the 24-residue CaM binding region toward the N-terminal end. This is unlike the CaM-dependent protein kinases that have CaM binding sites and AIDs immediately adjacent in sequence. Our data demonstrate that not only does the CaM binding region folds but also an ∼25- to 30-residue region between it and the AID folds, resulting in over half of the RD adopting $\alpha$-helical structure. This appears to be the first observation of CaM inducing folding of this scale outside of its binding site on a target protein.},

abstract = {Image-based meshing is opening up exciting new possibilities for the application of computational continuum mechanics methods (finite-element and computational fluid dynamics) to a wide range of biomechanical and biomedical problems that were previously intractable owing to the difficulty in obtaining suitably realistic models. Innovative surface and volume mesh generation techniques have recently been developed, which convert three-dimensional imaging data, as obtained from magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, micro-CT and ultrasound, for example, directly into meshes suitable for use in physics-based simulations. These techniques have several key advantages, including the ability to robustly generate meshes for topologies of arbitrary complexity (such as bioscaffolds or composite micro-architectures) and with any number of constituent materials (multi-part modelling), providing meshes in which the geometric accuracy of mesh domains is only dependent on the image accuracy (image-based accuracy) and the ability for certain problems to model material inhomogeneity by assigning the properties based on image signal strength. Commonly used mesh generation techniques will be compared with the proposed enhanced volumetric marching cubes (EVoMaCs) approach and some issues specific to simulations based on three-dimensional image data will be discussed. A number of case studies will be presented to illustrate how these techniques can be used effectively across a wide range of problems from characterization of micro-scaffolds through to head impact modelling.},

With the increase in biophysical and physiological data available, the modeling has become more sophisticated with investigations spanning in scale from molecular components to whole cells. These modeling efforts have provided insight into cardiac excitation-contraction coupling that advanced and complemented experimental studies. One goal is to extend these detailed cellular models to model the whole heart. While this has been done with mechanical and electrophysiological models, the complexity and fast time course of calcium dynamics have made inclusion of detailed calcium dynamics in whole heart models impractical.

However, on the basis of their reported results we find it impossible to assess the merits of their model because their results and claims concerning selectivity are based on an extrapolation over four orders of magnitude to low Ca(2+) concentration. Their results and claims have been presented in several articles and reviews in several journals and, thus, need attention. In this article, we first establish that we obtain results on electrostatics and channel occupancies similar to the high-concentration simulations they present. We then perform grand canonical ensemble simulations that enable us to study micromolar Ca(2+) concentrations. We find that their model channel is only weakly Ca(2+) selective. A crucial problem with their model appears to be the placement of the negatively charged glutamate structural elements in fixed positions inside the protein rather than as flexible units inside the filter.},

Critical to this process is the availability of ATP, which myosin hydrolyzes during the cross-bridge cycle. The diffusion of adenine nucleotides through the myofilament lattice has been shown to be anisotropic, with slower radial diffusion perpendicular to the filament axis relative to parallel, and is attributed to the periodic hexagonal arrangement of the thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments. We investigated whether atomistic-resolution details of myofilament proteins can refine coarse-grain estimates of diffusional anisotropy for adenine nucleotides in the cardiac myofibril, using homogenization theory and atomistic thin filament models from the Protein Data Bank. Our results demonstrate considerable anisotropy in ATP and ADP diffusion constants that is consistent with experimental measurements and dependent on lattice spacing and myofilament overlap. A reaction-diffusion model of the half-sarcomere further suggests that diffusional anisotropy may lead to modest adenine nucleotide gradients in the myoplasm under physiological conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Competition between reactive species is commonplace in typical chemical reactions. Specifically the primary reaction between a substrate and its target enzyme may be altered when interactions with secondary species in the system are substantial. We explore this competition phenomenon for diffusion-limited reactions in the presence of neighboring particles through numerical solution of the diffusion equation. As a general model for globular proteins and small molecules, we consider spherical representations of the reactants and neighboring particles; these neighbors vary in local density, size, distribution, and relative distance from the primary target reaction, as well as their surface reactivity. Modulations of these model variables permit inquiry into the influence of excluded volume and competition on the primary reaction due to the presence of neighboring particles. We find that the surface reactivity effect is long-ranged and a strong determinant of reaction kinetics, whereas the excluded volume effect is relatively short-ranged and less influential in comparison. As a consequence, the effect of the excluded volume is only modestly dependent on the neighbor distribution and is approximately additive; this additivity permits a linear approximation to the many-body effect on the reaction kinetics. In contrast, the surface reactivity effect is non-additive, and thus it may require higher-order approximations to describe the reaction kinetics. Our model study has broad implications in the general understanding of competition and local crowding on diffusion-limited chemical reactions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {Troponin C (TnC) is implicated in the initiation of myocyte contraction via binding of cytosolic Ca2+ and subsequent recognition of the Troponin I switch peptide. Mutations of the cardiac TnC N-terminal regulatory domain have been shown to alter both calcium binding and myofilament force generation. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of engineered TnC variants that increase or decrease Ca2+ sensitivity, in order to understand the structural basis of their impact on TnC function. We will use the distinction for mutants that are associated with increased Ca2+ affinity and for those mutants with reduced affinity. Our studies demonstrate that for GOF mutants V44Q and L48Q, the structure of the physiologically-active site II Ca2+ binding site in the Ca2+ -free (apo) state closely resembled the Ca2+ -bound (holo) state. In contrast, site II is very labile for LOF mutants E40A and V79Q in the apo form and bears little resemblance with the holo conformation. We hypothesize that these phenomena contribute to the increased association rate, Kon, for the GOF mutants relative to LOF. Furthermore, we observe significant positive and negative positional correlations between helices in the GOF holo mutants that are not found in the LOF mutants. We anticipate these correlations may contribute either directly to Ca2+ affinity or indirectly through TnI association. Our observations based on the structure and dynamics of mutant TnC provide rationale for binding trends observed in GOF and LOF mutants and will guide the development of inotropic drugs that target TnC. {\textcopyright} 2012 Kekenes-Huskey et al.},

abstract = {This paper presents a brief review of multi-scale modeling at the molecular to cellular scale, with new results for heart muscle cells. A finite element-based simulation package (SMOL) was used to investigate the signaling transduction at molecular and sub-cellular scales (http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/ smol/, http://FETK.org) by numerical solution of the time-dependent Smoluchowski equations and a reaction-diffusion system. At the molecular scale, SMOL has yielded experimentally validated estimates of the diffusion-limited association rates for the binding of acetylcholine to mouse acetylcholinesterase using crystallographic structural data. The predicted rate constants exhibit increasingly delayed steady-state times, with increasing ionic strength, and demonstrate the role of an enzyme's electrostatic potential in influencing ligand binding. At the sub-cellular scale, an extension of SMOL solves a nonlinear, reaction-diffusion system describing Ca 2+ ligand buffering and diffusion in experimentally derived rodent ventricular myocyte geometries. Results reveal the important role of mobile and stationary Ca 2+ buffers, including Ca 2+ indicator dye. We found that alterations in Ca 2+-binding and dissociation rates of troponin C (TnC) and total TnC concentration modulate sub-cellular Ca 2+ signals. The model predicts that reduced off-rate in the whole troponin complex (TnC, TnI, TnT) versus reconstructed thin filaments (Tn, Tm, actin) alters cytosolic Ca 2+ dynamics under control conditions or in disease-linked TnC mutations. The ultimate goal of these studies is to develop scalable methods and theories for the integration of molecular-scale information into simulations of cellular-scale systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Ar is an abbreviation for a substituted benzene ring, for which X can be either chlorine or fluorine, and R is either a hydroxyl or methoxy group.

The focus of this study is to apply coarse-grain molecular docking procedures coupled with fine-grain all-atom force field optimization strategies to shed light on the binding mechanisms of currently available estrogen receptor-active compounds. Although the mechanics of ligand binding in estrogen receptors is generally well understood, there is room for surprises.

Included in this type I agonistic mode are the DES derivatives, transstilbene and 1,2-diaryldiaminoethane. In addition, a novel 'type II agonistic' binding mode for 2,3-diarylimidazolines, 4,5-diarylimidazoles, 2,3-diarylpiperazines is introduced.

We predicted that the R-F-NH2 part of the tetrapeptide sticks down into the protein between the transmembrane (TM) domains 3, 4, 5, and 6. The Phe (F-NH2) interacted favorably with Tyr110 (TM3), while the Arg makes salt bridges to Asp161 (TM4) and Asp179 (TM5). We predicted that the Met extends from the binding site, but the terminal Phe residue sticks back into an aromatic/hydrophobic site flanked by Tyr237, Leu238, Leu240, and Tyr256 (TM6), and Trp162 (TM4). We carried out subsequent mutagenesis experiments followed by intracellular calcium-release assays that demonstrated the dramatic decrease in activity for the Tyr110Ala, Asp161Ala, and Asp179Ala substitutions, which was predicted by our model. These experiments provide strong evidence that our predicted G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structure is sufficiently accurate to identify binding sites for selective ligands.

abstract = {The macroscopic diffusion constant for a charged diffuser is in part dependent on (1) the volume excluded by solute "obstacles" and (2) long-range interactions between those obstacles and the diffuser. Increasing excluded volume reduces transport of the diffuser, while long-range interactions can either increase or decrease diffusivity, depending on the nature of the potential. We previously demonstrated [P. M. Kekenes-Huskey et al., Biophys. J. 105, 2130 (2013)] using homogenization theory that the configuration of molecular-scale obstacles can both hinder diffusion and induce diffusional anisotropy for small ions. As the density of molecular obstacles increases, van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic interactions between obstacle and a diffuser become significant and can strongly influence the latter's diffusivity, which was neglected in our original model. Here, we extend this methodology to include a fixed (time-independent) potential of mean force, through homogenization of the Smoluchowski equation. We consider the diffusion of ions in crowded, hydrophilic environments at physiological ionic strengths and find that electrostatic and vdW interactions can enhance or depress effective diffusion rates for attractive or repulsive forces, respectively. Additionally, we show that the observed diffusion rate may be reduced independent of non-specific electrostatic and vdW interactions by treating obstacles that exhibit specific binding interactions as "buffers" that absorb free diffusers. Finally, we demonstrate that effective diffusion rates are sensitive to distribution of surface charge on a globular protein, Troponin C, suggesting that the use of molecular structures with atomistic-scale resolution can account for electrostatic influences on substrate transport. This approach offers new insight into the influence of molecular-scale, long-range interactions on transport of charged species, particularly for diffusion-influenced signaling events occurring in crowded cellular environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Substrates involved in these reactions can be strongly influenced by diffusion "barriers" arising from impenetrable cellular structures and macromolecules, as well as interactions with biomolecules, especially within crowded environments. For diffusion-influenced reactions, the spatial organization of diffusion barriers arising from intracellular structures, non-specific crowders, and specific-binders (buffers) strongly controls the temporal and spatial reaction kinetics. In this study, we use two prototypical biochemical reactions, a Goodwin oscillator, and a reaction with a periodic source/sink term to examine how a diffusion barrier that partitions substrates controls reaction behavior. Namely, we examine how conditions representative of a densely packed cytosol, including reduced accessible volume fraction, non-specific interactions, and buffers, impede diffusion over nanometer length-scales. We find that diffusion barriers can modulate the frequencies and amplitudes of coupled diffusion-influenced reaction networks, as well as give rise to "compartments" of decoupled reactant populations. These effects appear to be intensified in the presence of buffers localized to the diffusion barrier. These findings have strong implications for the role of the cellular environment in tuning the dynamics of signaling pathways.},

This process initiates contraction, making it an important target for studies investigating the detailed molecular processes that underlie contraction. Here we use microsecond-timescale Anton molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics and kinetics of the opening transition of the TnC hydrophobic patch. Free-energy differences for opening are calculated for wild-type Ca2+-bound TnC (∼8 kcal/mol), V44Q Ca2+-bound TnC (3.2 kcal/mol), E40A Ca2+-bound TnC (∼12 kcal/mol), and wild-type apo TnC (∼20 kcal/mol). These results suggest that the mutations have a profound impact on the frequency with which the hydrophobic patch presents to TnI. In addition, these simulations corroborate that cardiac wild-type TnC does not open on timescales relevant to contraction without calcium being bound. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Biophysical Society. During $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at sites S23/S24, located at the N-terminus of cTnI. This phosphorylation has been shown to decrease KCa and pCa50, and weaken the cTnC-cTnI (C-I) interaction. We recently reported that phosphorylation results in an increase in the rate of early, slow phase of relaxation (kREL,slow) and a decrease in its duration (tREL,slow), which speeds up the overall relaxation. However, as the N-terminus of cTnI (residues 1-40) has not been resolved in the whole cardiac troponin (cTn) structure, little is known about the molecular-level behavior within the whole cTn complex upon phosphorylation of the S23/S24 residues of cTnI that results in these changes in function. In this study, we built up the cTn complex structure (including residues cTnC 1-161, cTnI 1-172, and cTnT 236-285) with the N-terminus of cTnI. We performed molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the structural basis of PKA phosphorylation-induced changes in cTn structure and Ca2+ binding. We found that introducing two phosphomimic mutations into sites S23/S24 had no significant effect on the coordinating residues of Ca2+ binding site II. However, the overall fluctuation of cTn was increased and the C-I interaction was altered relative to the wild-type model. The most significant changes involved interactions with the N-terminus of cTnI. Interestingly, the phosphomimic mutations led to the formation of intrasubunit interactions between the N-terminus and the inhibitory peptide of cTnI. This may result in altered interactions with cTnC and could explain the increased rate and decreased duration of slow-phase relaxation seen in myofibrils.},

abstract = {Troponin C (TnC) is an important regulatory molecule in cardiomyocytes. Calcium binding to site II in TnC initiates a series of molecular events that result in muscle contraction. The most direct change upon Ca2+ binding is an opening motion of the molecule that exposes a hydrophobic patch on the surface allowing for Troponin I to bind. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to elucidate the dynamics of this crucial protein in three different states: apo, Ca2+-bound, and Ca2+-TnI-bound. Dynamics between the states are compared, and the Ca2+-bound system is investigated for opening motions. On the basis of the simulations, NMR chemical shifts and order parameters are calculated and compared with experimental observables. Agreement indicates that the simulations sample the relevant dynamics of the system. Brownian dynamics simulations are used to investigate the calcium association of TnC. We find that calcium binding gives rise to correlative motions involving the EF hand and collective motions conducive of formation of the TnI-binding interface. We furthermore indicate the essential role of electrostatic steering in facilitating diffusion-limited binding of Ca2+. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases guard the fidelity of cognate amino acid incorporation during protein biosynthesis; for example, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) activates and transfers only Phe to its tRNA. Since we are interested in using a computational protocol to identify nonnatural amino acids that are incorporated by wild-type PheRS, it is critical to understand the fidelity of PheRS in binding the 20 natural amino acids. To this end, HierDock, a computational protocol for predicting binding sites and relative binding affinities, was used for testing the natural amino acids in PheRS. Scanning the entire ligand-accessible protein surface for the best binding region, we find that HierDock correctly identifies the active site of Phe in PheRS and predicts Phe within 0.61 {\AA} RMSD of the crystal structure. HierDock also successfully shows PheRS discriminates for Phe, as the noncognate amino acids bind less favorably in the binding site of Phe. However, we find that Met, Cys, and Tyr bind competitively but at positions distant from the Phe binding site. This result corroborates in vitro measurements of aminoacyl adenylate formation, which show Met competes with Phe at the amino acid binding stage. We predict that the binding site of Met would not activate PheRS, as the noncognate amino acid cannot establish suitable hydrogen bonds with the PheRS reaction center. These results validate the use of HierDock in predicting the binding sites of the cognate amino acids in PheRS. The HierDock procedure calculates the discrimination of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases at the stage of binding the cognate amino acid and offers a molecular level understanding of the mistakes made in protein biosynthesis that are not readily uncovered through experiments. This technique is also useful for predicting the binding of a selected nonnatural amino acid analogue, thereby indicating whether the molecule would be incorporated into a wild-type aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.},

This combines elements of DOCK4.0 with molecular dynamics (MD) methods available in the software, MPSim. We test here the efficacy of MPSim-Dock to predict the 64 protein-ligand combinations formed by starting with eight trypsin cocrystals, and crossdocking the other seven ligands to each protein conformation. We consider this as a model for how well the method would work for one given target protein structure. Using as a criterion that the structures within 2 kcal/mol of the top scoring include a conformation within a coordinate root mean square (CRMS) of 1 {\AA} of the crystal structure, we find that 100{\%} of the 64 cases are predicted correctly.

We investigate the influence of enzyme distributions and long-range molecular interactions on reaction kinetics, which have been exploited in biological systems to maximize metabolic efficiency and signaling effects. Specifically, we examine how the maximal rate of product generation in a series of sequential reactions is dependent on the enzyme distribution and the electrostatic composition of its participant enzymes and substrates. We find that close proximity between enzymes does not guarantee optimal reaction rates, as the benefit of decreasing enzyme separation is countered by the volume excluded by adjacent enzymes. We further quantify the extent to which the electrostatic potential increases the efficiency of transferring substrate between enzymes, which supports the existence of electrostatic channeling in nature. Here, a major finding is that the role of attractive electrostatic interactions in confining intermediate substrates in the vicinity of the enzymes can contribute more to net reactive throughput than the directional properties of the electrostatic fields. These findings shed light on the interplay of long-range interactions and enzyme distributions in coupled enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and their influence on signaling in biological systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Triggered release of Ca2+ from an individual sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release unit (CRU) is the fundamental event of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, and spontaneous release events (sparks) are the major contributor to diastolic Ca2+ leak in cardiomyocytes. Previous model studies have predicted that the duration and magnitude of the spark is determined by the local CRU geometry, as well as the localization and density of Ca2+ handling proteins. We have created a detailed computational model of a CRU, and developed novel tools to generate the computational geometry from electron tomographic images. Ca2+ diffusion was modelled within the SR and the cytosol to examine the effects of localization and density of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2 (SERCA), and calsequestrin on spark dynamics. We reconcile previous model predictions of approximately 90{\%} local Ca2+ depletion in junctional SR, with experimental reports of about 40{\%}. This analysis supports the hypothesis that dye kinetics and optical averaging effects can have a significant impact on measures of spark dynamics. Our model also predicts that distributing calsequestrin within non-junctional Z-disc SR compartments, in addition to the junctional compartment, prolongs spark release time as reported by Fluo5. By pumping Ca2+ back into the SR during a release, SERCA is able to prolong a Ca2+ spark, and this may contribute to SERCA-dependent changes in Ca2+ wave speed. Finally, we show that including the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inside the dyadic cleft does not alter local [Ca2+] during a spark. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Physiological Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Biophysical Society. Cardiac troponin (cTn) is a key molecule in the regulation of human cardiac muscle contraction. The N-terminal cardiac-specific peptide of the inhibitory subunit of troponin, cTnI (cTnI1-39), is a target for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) during $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation. We recently presented evidence indicating that this peptide interacts with the inhibitory peptide (cTnl137-147) when S23 and S24 are phosphorylated. The inhibitory peptide is also the target of the point mutation cTnI-R145G, which is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a disease associated with sudden death in apparently healthy young adults. It has been shown that both phosphorylation and this mutation alter the cTnC-cTnI (C-I) interaction, which plays a crucial role in modulating contractile activation. However, little is known about the molecular-level events underlying this modulation. Here, we computationally investigated the effects of the cTnI-R145G mutation on the dynamics of cTn, cTnC Ca2+ handling, and the C-I interaction. Comparisons were made with the cTnI-R145G/S23D/S24D phosphomimic mutation, which has been used both experimentally and computationally to study the cTnI N-terminal specific effects of PKA phosphorylation. Additional comparisons between the phosphomimic mutations and the real phosphorylations were made. For this purpose, we ran triplicate 150 ns molecular dynamics simulations of cTnI-R145G Ca2+-bound cTnC1-161-cTnI1-172-cTnT236-285, cTnI-R145G/S23D/S24D Ca2+-bound cTnC1-161-cTnI1-172-cTnT236-285, and cTnI-R145G/PS23/PS24 Ca2+-bound cTnC1-161-cTnI1-172-cTnT236-285, respectively. We found that the cTnI-R145G mutation did not impact the overall dynamics of cTn, but stabilized crucial Ca2+-coordinating interactions. However, the phosphomimic mutations increased overall cTn fluctuations and destabilized Ca2+ coordination. Interestingly, cTnI-R145G blunted the intrasubunit interactions between the cTnI N-terminal extension and the cTnI inhibitory peptide, which have been suggested to play a crucial role in modulating troponin function during $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation. These findings offer a molecular-level explanation for how the HCM mutation cTnI-R145G reduces the modulation of cTn by phosphorylation of S23/S24 during $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation.},

Here, the PBE and the SMPBE are reevaluated for realistic molecular systems, namely, lipid bilayers, under eight different sets of input parameters. The SMPBE appears to reproduce the molecular dynamics simulation results better than the PBE only under specific parameter sets, but in general, it performs no better than the Stern layer correction of the PBE.

abstract = {Water plays a crucial part in virtually all protein-ligand binding processes in and out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the role of water in the binding kinetics of a ligand to a prototypical hydrophobic pocket by explicit-water molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and implicit diffusional approaches. The concave pocket in the unbound state exhibits wet/dry hydration oscillations whose magnitude and time scale are significantly amplified by the approaching ligand. In turn, the ligand's stochastic motion intimately couples to the slow hydration fluctuations, leading to a sixfold-enhanced friction in the vicinity of the pocket entrance. The increased friction considerably decelerates association in the otherwise barrierless system, indicating the importance of molecular-scale hydrodynamic effects in cavity-ligand binding arising due to capillary fluctuations. We derive and analyze the diffusivity profile and show that the mean first passage time distribution from the MD simulation can be accurately reproduced by a standard Brownian dynamics simulation if the appropriate position-dependent friction profile is included. However, long-time decays in the water-ligand (random) force autocorrelation demonstrate violation of the Markovian assumption, challenging standard diffusive approaches for rate prediction. Remarkably, the static friction profile derived fromthe force correlations strongly resembles the profile derived on the Markovian assumption apart from a simple shift in space, which can be rationalized by a time-space retardation in the ligand's downhill dynamics toward the pocket. The observed spatiotemporal hydrodynamic coupling may be of biological importance providing the time needed for conformational receptor-ligand adjustments, typical of the induced-fit paradigm.},

Our model includes a realistic 3D geometry of a single ttubule and its surrounding half-sarcomeres for rabbit ventricular myocytes. The effects of spatially distributed membrane ion-transporters (LCC, Na +/Ca 2+ exchanger, sarcolemmal Ca 2+ pump, and sarcolemmal Ca 2+ leak), and stationary and mobile Ca 2+ buffers (troponin C, ATP, calmodulin, and Fluo-3) are also considered. We used a coupled reaction-diffusion system to describe the spatio-temporal concentration profiles of free and buffered intracellular Ca 2+. We obtained parameters from voltage-clamp protocols of L-type Ca 2+ current and line-scan recordings of Ca 2+ concentration profiles in rabbit cells, in which the sarcoplasmic reticulum is disabled. Our model results agree with experimental measurements of global Ca 2+ transient in myocytes loaded with 50 $\mu$M Fluo-3. We found that local Ca 2+ concentrations within the cytosol and sub-sarcolemma, as well as the local trigger fluxes of Ca 2+ crossing the cell membrane, are sensitive to details of t-tubule micro-structure and membrane Ca 2+ flux distribution. The model additionally predicts that local Ca 2+ trigger fluxes are at least threefold to eightfold higher than the whole-cell Ca 2+ trigger flux. We found also that the activation of allosteric Ca 2+-binding sites on the Na +/Ca 2+ exchanger could provide a mechanism for regulating global and local Ca 2+ trigger fluxes in vivo. Our studies indicate that improved structural and functional models could improve our understanding of the contributions of L-type and Na +/Ca 2+ exchanger fluxes to intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Kekenes-Huskey, Cheng, Hake, Sachse, Bridge, Holst, McCammon, McCulloch and Michailova.},

abstract = {SignificanceA crucial factor for drug efficacy is not just the binding affinity, but also the mean residence time in the binding pocket, usually quantified by its inverse, koff. This is an important parameter that regulates the time during which the drug is active. Whereas the calculation of the binding affinity is by now routine, the calculation of koff has proven more challenging because the timescales involved far exceed the limits of standard molecular dynamics simulation. We propose a metadynamics-based strategy that allows reaching timescales of seconds, and estimate koff along with unbinding pathways and associated dynamical bottlenecks. The protocol is exemplified for trypsin-benzamidine unbinding. This work is a step towards a more effective computer-based drug design. The ability to predict the mechanisms and the associated rate constants of protein-ligand unbinding is of great practical importance in drug design. In this work we demonstrate how a recently introduced metadynamics-based approach allows exploration of the unbinding pathways, estimation of the rates, and determination of the rate-limiting steps in the paradigmatic case of the trypsin-benzamidine system. Protein, ligand, and solvent are described with full atomic resolution. Using metadynamics, multiple unbinding trajectories that start with the ligand in the crystallographic binding pose and end with the ligand in the fully solvated state are generated. The unbinding rate [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} is computed from the mean residence time of the ligand. Using our previously computed binding affinity we also obtain the binding rate [IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}. Both rates are in agreement with reported experimental values. We uncover the complex pathways of unbinding trajectories and describe the critical rate-limiting steps with unprecedented detail. Our findings illuminate the role played by the coupling between subtle protein backbone fluctuations and the solvation by water molecules that enter the binding pocket and assist in the breaking of the shielded hydrogen bonds. We expect our approach to be useful in calculating rates for general protein-ligand systems and a valid support for drug design.},

abstract = {The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily consists of a large number of nonselective cation channels with variable degree of Ca(2+)-permeability. The 28 mammalian TRP channel proteins can be grouped into six subfamilies: canonical, vanilloid, melastatin, ankyrin, polycystic, and mucolipin TRPs. The majority of these TRP channels are expressed in different cell types including both excitable and nonexcitable cells of the cardiovascular system. Unlike voltage-gated ion channels, TRP channels do not have a typical voltage sensor, but instead can sense a variety of other stimuli including pressure, shear stress, mechanical stretch, oxidative stress, lipid environment alterations, hypertrophic signals, and inflammation products. By integrating multiple stimuli and transducing their activity to downstream cellular signal pathways via Ca(2+) entry and/or membrane depolarization, TRP channels play an essential role in regulating fundamental cell functions such as contraction, relaxation, proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. With the use of targeted deletion and transgenic mouse models, recent studies have revealed that TRP channels are involved in numerous cellular functions and play an important role in the pathophysiology of many diseases in the cardiovascular system. Moreover, several TRP channels are involved in inherited diseases of the cardiovascular system. This review presents an overview of current knowledge concerning the physiological functions of TRP channels in the cardiovascular system and their contributions to cardiovascular diseases. Ultimately, TRP channels may become potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle depends upon trafficking of CaV1.1, the principal subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) (L-type Ca(2+) channel), to plasma membrane regions at which the DHPRs interact with type 1 ryanodine receptors (RyR1) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A distinctive feature of this trafficking is that CaV1.1 expresses poorly or not at all in mammalian cells that are not of muscle origin (e.g., tsA201 cells), in which all of the other nine CaV isoforms have been successfully expressed. Here, we tested whether plasma membrane trafficking of CaV1.1 in tsA201 cells is promoted by the adapter protein Stac3, because recent work has shown that genetic deletion of Stac3 in skeletal muscle causes the loss of EC coupling. Using fluorescently tagged constructs, we found that Stac3 and CaV1.1 traffic together to the tsA201 plasma membrane, whereas CaV1.1 is retained intracellularly when Stac3 is absent. Moreover, L-type Ca(2+) channel function in tsA201 cells coexpressing Stac3 and CaV1.1 is quantitatively similar to that in myotubes, despite the absence of RyR1. Although Stac3 is not required for surface expression of CaV1.2, the principle subunit of the cardiac/brain L-type Ca(2+) channel, Stac3 does bind to CaV1.2 and, as a result, greatly slows the rate of current inactivation, with Stac2 acting similarly. Overall, these results indicate that Stac3 is an essential chaperone of CaV1.1 in skeletal muscle and that in the brain, Stac2 and Stac3 may significantly modulate CaV1.2 function.},

Here we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the transfer of single-file water molecules across straight or nonstraight single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). In contrast with the macroscopic scenario, the nonstraight nanostructure can increase the water permeation. Remarkably, compared with the straight SWCNT, the nonstraight SWCNT with the minimal bending angle of 35° in the simulations can enhance the water transport up to 3.5 times. This enhancement mainly originates from the Lennard-Jones interaction between water molecules and nonstraight nanostructures. Our work offers an additional freedom to design high-flux nanochannels by choosing nonstraight nanostructures and provides an insight into water flow across biological water nanochannels, which are often nonstraight since they are composed of integral membrane proteins.},

abstract = {The control of the physicochemical properties of silica particles is of paramount importance to achieve full functionality in specific applications. A novel facile method of silica particle synthesis, requiring only two reactants, was developed. Control of the surface charge of these newly synthesized silica particles was achieved via the rapid electrostatic adsorption and acidic desorption of the branched, biomimetic polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI). Successful adsorption/desorption of PEI was supported by ATR-FTIR spectra, an adsorption isotherm, and $\zeta$-potential curves. PEI adsorption above a threshold PEI concentration was determined to categorically change the topography of the silica particles' $\zeta$-potential curve. The results from our study convey a rapid, reversible, and reliable method of silica particle surface charge control. This may be of particular use in tailoring surface interactions of silica or silica-coated particles for applications in drug delivery, biomedical technologies, catalysis, and coatings.},

abstract = {Understanding how allosteric proteins respond to changes in their environment is a major goal of current biological research. We show that these responses can be quantified by analyzing protein energy networks using a method recently developed in our group. Based on this method, we introduce here a quantity named energetic coupling, which we show is able to discriminate allosterically active mutants of the lactose repressor (LacI) protein, and of the catabolite activator protein (CAP), a dynamically-driven allosteric protein. Our method assumes that allostery and signal transmission can be more accurately described as efficient energy propagation, and not as the more widely-used atomic motion correlations. We demonstrate the validity of this assumption by performing energy-propagation simulations. Finally, we present results from energy-propagation simulations performed on folded and fully-extended conformations of the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). They show that the protein backbone provides a more efficient route for energy transfer, when compared to secondary or tertiary contacts. Based on this, we propose energy propagation through the backbone as a possible explanation for the observation that intrinsically disordered proteins can efficiently transmit signals while lacking a well-defined tertiary structure.},

abstract = {Cl(-) is a major anion in mammalian cells involved in transport processes that determines the intracellular activity of many ions and plasma membrane potential. Surprisingly, a role of intracellular Cl(-) (Cl(-) in) as a signaling ion has not been previously evaluated. Here we report that Cl(-) in functions as a regulator of cellular Na(+) and HCO3 (-) concentrations and transepithelial transport through modulating the activity of several electrogenic Na(+)-HCO3 (-) transporters. We describe the molecular mechanism(s) of this regulation by physiological Cl(-) in concentrations highlighting the role of GXXXP motifs in Cl(-) sensing. Regulation of the ubiquitous Na(+)-HCO3(-) co-transport (NBC)e1-B is mediated by two GXXXP-containing sites; regulation of NBCe2-C is dependent on a single GXXXP motif; and regulation of NBCe1-A depends on a cryptic GXXXP motif. In the basal state NBCe1-B is inhibited by high Cl(-) in interacting at a low affinity GXXXP-containing site. IP3 receptor binding protein released with IP3 (IRBIT) activation of NBCe1-B unmasks a second high affinity Cl(-) in interacting GXXXP-dependent site. By contrast, NBCe2-C, which does not interact with IRBIT, has a single high affinity N-terminal GXXP-containing Cl(-) in interacting site. NBCe1-A is unaffected by Cl(-) in between 5 and 140 mM. However, deletion of NBCe1-A residues 29-41 unmasks a cryptic GXXXP-containing site homologous with the NBCe1-B low affinity site that is involved in inhibition of NBCe1-A by Cl(-) in. These findings reveal a cellular Cl(-) in sensing mechanism that plays an important role in the regulation of Na(+) and HCO3 (-) transport, with critical implications for the role of Cl(-) in cellular ion homeostasis and epithelial fluid and electrolyte secretion.},

@article{Tzul2015,
abstract = {SignificanceQuantitative understanding of how individual interactions contribute to the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein folding is critical for deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms that define the energy folding landscape. We applied a structure-based model that explicitly accounts for the interactions between charges, to folding-unfolding of four different protein pairs: rationally stabilized, via optimization of surface charge-charge interactions, variants, and respective wild types. First, we established that the models predict both thermodynamic and kinetic differences observed experimentally for all four studied protein pairs. Second, we used the results of the computational modeling to provide a molecular level explanation of how optimization of charge-charge interactions leads to an increase in the folding rates of designed variants, without changes in the unfolding rates. The kinetics of folding-unfolding of a structurally diverse set of four proteins optimized for thermodynamic stability by rational redesign of surface charge-charge interactions is characterized experimentally. The folding rates are faster for designed variants compared with their wild-type proteins, whereas the unfolding rates are largely unaffected. A simple structure-based computational model, which incorporates the Debye-Huckel formalism for the electrostatics, was used and found to qualitatively recapitulate the experimental results. Analysis of the energy landscapes of the designed versus wild-type proteins indicates the differences in refolding rates may be correlated with the degree of frustration of their respective energy landscapes. Our simulations indicate that naturally occurring wild-type proteins have frustrated folding landscapes due to the surface electrostatics. Optimization of the surface electrostatics seems to remove some of that frustration, leading to enhanced formation of native-like contacts in the transition-state ensembles (TSE) and providing a less frustrated energy landscape between the unfolded and TS ensembles. Macroscopically, this results in faster folding rates. Furthermore, analyses of pairwise distances and radii of gyration suggest that the less frustrated energy landscapes for optimized variants are a result of more compact unfolded and TS ensembles. These findings from our modeling demonstrates that this simple model may be used to: (i) gain a detailed understanding of charge-charge interactions and their effects on modulating the energy landscape of protein folding and (ii) qualitatively predict the kinetic behavior of protein surface electrostatic interactions.},

abstract = {An analysis of the diffusiophoretic motion in a suspension of charged porous spheres in an electrolytic solution with a macroscopic concentration gradient is presented. Each porous particle can be a solvent-permeable and ion-penetrable charged floc or polyelectrolyte molecule, in which the densities of the fixed charges and frictional segments are constant, surrounded by an arbitrary electric double layer. The multiparticle interaction effects are considered through the use of a unit cell model, which allows the overlap of adjacent double layers. The differential equations governing the electric potential, ionic concentration, and fluid velocity distributions inside and outside the porous particle in a unit cell are linearized by assuming that the system is only slightly deviated from equilibrium and then solved as power expansions in its dimensionless fixed-charge density. A closed-form expression for the diffusiophoretic velocity of the porous particle correct to the second order of the fixed charge density is obtained from a balance between the electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces acting on it. Detailed comparisons of the results for the multiparticle diffusiophoresis obtained from the cell model with various boundary conditions are made. The effect of particle interactions on the diffusiophoresis, which is a linear combination of electrophoresis and chemiphoresis, can be significant and complicated in typical situations. Although the electrophoretic mobility of the particles decreases with an increase in the particle volume fraction, their chemiphoretic mobility is not necessarily a monotonic function of it.},

abstract = {Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells, involved in numerous calcium-regulated biological phenomena, such as synaptic plasticity, muscle contraction, cell cycle, and circadian rhythms. It exibits a characteristic dumbell shape, with two globular domains (N- and C-terminal lobe) joined by a linker region. Each lobe can take alternative conformations, affected by the binding of calcium and target proteins. Calmodulin displays considerable functional flexibility due to its capability to bind different targets, often in a tissue-specific fashion. In various specific physiological environments (e.g. skeletal muscle, neuron dendritic spines) several targets compete for the same calmodulin pool, regulating its availability and affinity for calcium. In this work, we sought to understand the general principles underlying calmodulin modulation by different target proteins, and to account for simultaneous effects of multiple competing targets, thus enabling a more realistic simulation of calmodulin-dependent pathways. We built a mechanistic allosteric model of calmodulin, based on an hemiconcerted framework: each calmodulin lobe can exist in two conformations in thermodynamic equilibrium, with different affinities for calcium and different affinities for each target. Each lobe was allowed to switch conformation on its own. The model was parameterised and validated against experimental data from the literature. In spite of its simplicity, a two-state allosteric model was able to satisfactorily represent several sets of experiments, in particular the binding of calcium on intact and truncated calmodulin and the effect of different skMLCK peptides on calmodulin's saturation curve. The model can also be readily extended to include multiple targets. We show that some targets stabilise the low calcium affinity T state while others stabilise the high affinity R state. Most of the effects produced by calmodulin targets can be explained as modulation of a pre-existing dynamic equilibrium between different conformations of calmodulin's lobes, in agreement with linkage theory and MWC-type models.},

abstract = {Proteinopathy causes cardiac disease, remodeling, and heart failure but the pathological mechanisms remain obscure. Mutated $\alpha$B-crystallin (CryAB(R120G)), when expressed only in cardiomyocytes in transgenic (TG) mice, causes desmin-related cardiomyopathy, a protein conformational disorder. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of toxic misfolded protein species that present as perinuclear aggregates known as aggresomes. Previously, we have used the CryAB(R120G) model to determine the underlying processes that result in these pathologic accumulations and to explore potential therapeutic windows that might be used to decrease proteotoxicity. We noted that total ventricular protein is hypoacetylated while hyperacetylation of $\alpha$-tubulin, a substrate of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) occurs. HDAC6 has critical roles in protein trafficking and autophagy, but its function in the heart is obscure. Here, we test the hypothesis that tubulin acetylation is an adaptive process in cardiomyocytes. By modulating HDAC6 levels and/or activity genetically and pharmacologically, we determined the effects of tubulin acetylation on aggregate formation in CryAB(R120G) cardiomyocytes. Increasing HDAC6 accelerated aggregate formation, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological inhibition ameliorated the process. HDAC inhibition in vivo induced tubulin hyperacetylation in CryAB(R120G) TG hearts, which prevented aggregate formation and significantly improved cardiac function. HDAC6 inhibition also increased autophagic flux in cardiomyocytes, and increased autophagy in the diseased heart correlated with increased tubulin acetylation, suggesting that autophagy induction might underlie the observed cardioprotection. Taken together, our data suggest a mechanistic link between tubulin hyperacetylation and autophagy induction and points to HDAC6 as a viable therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {In this study, we numerically analyzed the nonlinear Ca(2+)-dependent gating dynamics of a single, nonconducting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channel, using an exact and fully stochastic simulation algorithm that includes channel gating, Ca(2+) buffering, and Ca(2+) diffusion. The IP3R is a ubiquitous intracellular Ca(2+) release channel that plays an important role in the formation of complex spatiotemporal Ca(2+) signals such as waves and oscillations. Dynamic subfemtoliter Ca(2+) microdomains reveal low copy numbers of Ca(2+) ions, buffer molecules, and IP3Rs, and stochastic fluctuations arising from molecular interactions and diffusion do not average out. In contrast to models treating calcium dynamics deterministically, the stochastic approach accounts for this molecular noise. We varied Ca(2+) diffusion coefficients and buffer reaction rates to tune the autocorrelation properties of Ca(2+) noise and found a distinct relation between the autocorrelation time $\tau$ac, the mean channel open and close times, and the resulting IP3R open probability PO. We observed an increased PO for shorter noise autocorrelation times, caused by increasing channel open times and decreasing close times. In a pure diffusion model the effects become apparent at elevated calcium concentrations, e.g., at [Ca(2+)] = 25 $\mu$M, $\tau$ac = 0.082 ms, the IP3R open probability increased by ≈20{\%} and mean open times increased by ≈4 ms, compared to a zero noise model. We identified the inactivating Ca(2+) binding site of IP3R subunits as the primarily noise-susceptible element of the De Young and Keizer model. Short Ca(2+) noise autocorrelation times decrease the probability of Ca(2+) association and consequently increase IP3R activity. These results suggest a functional role of local calcium noise properties on calcium-regulated target molecules such as the ubiquitous IP3R. This finding may stimulate novel experimental approaches analyzing the role of calcium noise properties on microdomain behavior.},

abstract = {The role of entropic contributions in processes involving biomolecules is illustrated using the process of vaporization or condensation of the solvents water and methanol and the process of polypeptide folding in solution using molecular models at different levels of resolution: subatomic, atomic, supra-atomic, and supramolecular. For the folding process, a $\beta$-hexapeptide that adopts, as inferred from NMR experiments, both a right-handed 2.710/12-helical fold and a left-handed 314-helical fold in methanol, is used to illustrate the challenge of modeling thermodynamically driven processes at different levels of resolution.},

abstract = {Numerous selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been synthesized and assayed in recent years. The focus of this study is to apply coarse-grain molecular docking procedures coupled with fine-grain all-atom force field optimization strategies to shed light on the binding mechanisms of currently available estrogen receptor-active compounds. Although the mechanics of ligand binding in estrogen receptors is generally well understood, there is room for surprises. In this paper computational evidence corroborating the experimentally observed type I agonistic binding mode for estradiol (E2) and diethylstilbesterol (DES) and the type II antagonistic binding mode for 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifen is presented. Included in this type I agonistic mode are the DES derivatives, transstilbene and 1,2-diaryldiaminoethane. In addition, a novel 'type II agonistic' binding mode for 2,3-diarylimidazolines, 4,5-diarylimidazoles, 2,3-diarylpiperazines is introduced. This mode is stabilized by suggesting alternative hydrogen bond anchor points in the ligand binding domain as potential leads for future drug design.},
